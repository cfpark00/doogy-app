BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: Already mentioned by
Xenophon, used as « oysel dog » widespread in the whole of Europe
under different names.  The breed was renewed and improved by
inbreeding, selection and training without any addition of foreign
blood by E.K. Korthals during the second half of the 19th century.
Since, the different national clubs have remained faithful to its
precepts.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: Vigorous dog, rustic of medium size.
Longer than tall.  The skull is not too broad.  The muzzle is long and
square.  The eyes, dark yellow or brown are surmounted but not
covered by bushy eyebrows and well developed moustaches and
beard give him a characteristic expression and express firmness and
assurance.

BEHAVIOUR / TEMPERAMENT: Gentle and proud, excellent
hunter, very attached to his master and his territory which he guards
with vigilance.  Very gentle with children.

HEAD: Big and long, with harsh hair, thick but not too long;
moustache, beard and eyebrows well developed.
