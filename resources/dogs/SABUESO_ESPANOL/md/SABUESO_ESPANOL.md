### SABUESO ESPAÑOL


(Spanish Hound)





FCI-St. N° 204 / 24.07.2000

TRANSLATION: Mrs. Peggy Davis.  Official language (ES).

ORIGIN: Spain.

### DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THE OFFICIAL VALID



### STANDARD: 26.05.1982.



UTILIZATION: Hunting hound for small game, although he is not
averse to big game hunting, be it boar, stag, deer, fox, wolf or the
bear.  The hunter, instructed by the dog’s voice and its modulations,
will recognize the sequence of events of the hunting and its incidents
such as : Cold or fresh line of scent, double scent lines, firmness on
line or « halali » (kill).  The Sabueso español (hound) is a great
specialist in hunting the hare with his doubling habit and he is most
efficient in blood tracking (searching of wounded big game).

### FCI-CLASSIFICATION:


Group 6
Scenthounds and related



breeds.

Section 1.2 Medium sized Hounds.

With working trial.



BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: Already known in the late
Middle Ages, he is brilliantly described by the venery book by King
Alphonse XI (XIVth century) as well as by Argote de Molina (1582)
and by numerous classic authors.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: Medium sized dog, balanced, with
rather long proportions, with a lovely head and long leathers.  The
development of his thoracic perimeter and the length of his body
which exceeds greatly the height at the withers, are remarkable.
Compact bone structure and solid legs; fine hair, smooth and flat.
The gaze is soft, sad and noble.

IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS: Long line structure.
• Length of the body is widely superior, from 7 to 10 cm, to the
height at the withers.



FCI-St. N° 204 / 24.07.2000
• Length of skull / length of muzzle = 1/1, i.e. they are of equal
length.

BEHAVIOUR / TEMPERAMENT: He is an affectionate and calm
dog which, when out hunting big game, shows extraordinary courage
and bravery.

HEAD: Harmonious, long and in proportion with the rest of the
body.  Cranial-facial lines divergent.  Seen from above, the ensemble
skull and muzzle must appear elongated and very uniform.  No
impression of pointed muzzle.

### CRANIAL REGION:


Skull: Medium width, broader in the males.  Convex profile.  The
width of the skull should be equal to its length; seen from the front, it
must be domed.  Occipital crest simply marked.
Stop: In gentle slope, only slightly marked.

### FACIAL REGION:


Nose: Large, moist with open and well developed nostrils.  Its colour
varies from light to intense black, always in relation with the colour
of the mucous membranes.
Muzzle: Straight profile, a very slight sub-convexity only at its end
portion admissible.  Seen from above, it appears moderately
rectangular, decreasing in width as it gets nearer the nose.
Lips: The upper lip must clearly cover the lower lip; it is loose and
moderately abundant.  The lower lip forms a well marked labial
corner.  The mucous membranes must be of the same colour as the
nose.  Palate of the same colour as the mucous membranes, with
marked ridges.
Jaws/Teeth: Scissor bite.  Teeth white and sound.  Canines well
developed, all premolars present.

EYES: Medium, almond shape, hazel colour, dark; with a sad, noble
and intelligent expression.  Eyelids pigmented like the nose and the
mucous membranes, close to the eyeball.  Slight relaxing at rest is
permitted.



FCI-St. N° 204 / 24.07.2000
EARS: The leathers are large, long and hanging.  Of soft texture,
rectangular shape and rounded tip.  Set below eye level and hang
freely twisted in corkscrew.  Without being stretched, they must
reach well beyond the nose.  The venous system is very visible and
just under the skin.

NECK: Truncated cone, broad and strong, muscled and supple; skin
thick and very loose, which forms, without exaggeration, a marked
and loose dewlap.

BODY: Clearly rectangular, very strong and robust, with an
important thoracic perimeter which must be more, by 1/3, than the
height at the withers: height at the withers 3, thoracic perimeter 4.
Topline: Straight, with a slight dip of the back and convexity of the
loin, characteristics of the breed, but not a saddle back.
Withers: Set forward and lightly marked.
Back: Powerful, broad, of marked length.
Loin: Very broad and powerful; slightly raised.
Croup: Powerful, broad, rather horizontal.  The height at the rump
must be the same or below the height at the withers.  Taking into
account the tendency of the breed to increase in size, it will be
permitted that the rump will be slightly higher.
Chest: Very developed, broad, deep and high, well let down to the
elbow.  Point of sternum marked.  Rounded ribs, with very wide
intercostal spaces, forming a large thoracic cage.
Underline and belly: Belly not very tucked up; the flanks are deep,
very visible, and full.

TAIL: Thick at the root and set at medium height.  Strong and
covered with very short hair forming a small paint brush at the tip.
At rest carried slightly curved and hanging down below the point of
the hock; at work and in action, it raises sabre fashion, without
excess, with a continual lateral movement.  Never straight, directed
upwards or resting on the rump.

### LIMBS



### FOREQUARTERS:


General appearance: Perfectly vertical, straight, parallel.  Give the
impression of being short and muscles and tendons are clearly
visible.  The length of the forearm must be equal to that of the
shoulder.  Of strong bone structure, with powerful pasterns; elbows
really close to the body.
Shoulder: Shoulder-blade oblique, rounded, muscled and of equal
length to that of the upper arm.  Scapulo-humeral angle: close to
100°.
Upperarm: Strong.
Elbow: Close to the thorax.  Humeral-radial angle: close to 120°.
Forearm: Straight, short, vertical.  Strong bones.
Pastern: Strong and powerful bone structure.  Seen in profile, only
slightly oblique.
Forefeet: Catfeet, toes tight, phalanges strong and high.  Nails strong
and solid, pads large and tough.  Interdigital membranes moderate
and covered with fine hair.

### HINDQUARTERS:


General appearance: Powerful, muscled and with excellent
angulation.  Legs correct, hocks without deviations, metatarsal long
and feet solid.  They give the dog the necessary strength, agility and
impulsion to follow the trail on very bumpy terrains and with
significant uneveness.
Upper thigh: Strong and muscular.  Coxal-femoral angle: near 100°.
Lower thigh: Of moderate length, muscular.  Femoral-tibial angle:
nearly 115°.
Hock: Well marked with the tendon clearly visible. Angle of the
hock open; getting close to 120°.
Hind feet: Catfeet, slightly oval.  More elongated than the front feet.
Present, or not, dewclaws are usually single, rarely double; their
removal is allowed.





FCI-St. N° 204 / 24.07.2000

GAIT / MOVEMENT: The preferred gait is the trot, which is long,
sustained and economical without tendency to lateralisation or
ambling.  Particular attention should be paid to the elbows and the
hocks whilst moving.  There is, in the walk, a natural tendency of the
breed to walk with the head low while sniffing.

SKIN: Very elastic, thick and pink in colour, loose all over the body;
on some occasions it forms wrinkles on the forehead when the head
is lowered.

### COAT


Hair: Dense, short, fine and smooth (flat).  Covering the whole of the
body down to the interdigital spaces.

Colour: White and orange, with dominance of one or the other colour
and distributed in irregular markings, well defined and without
ticking.  The orange colour may vary from a lighter shade (lemon) to
an intense russet-brown.

SIZE: This breed presents a pronounced sexual dimorphism which
reveals itself in the difference in size between the males and the
females; these last are noticeably smaller and finer.
Height at the withers:  males
from 52 to 57 cm,

females  from 48 to 53 cm.


In subjects of excellent proportions, 1 cm above the size limits is
tolerated.

FAULTS : Any departure from the foregoing points should be
considered a fault and the seriousness with which the fault should be
regarded should be in exact proportion to its degree and its effect
upon the health and welfare of the dog.
• Profile of the muzzle arched, but without excess.
• Pincer bite. Absence of one premolar.
• Loose eyelids to the point of uncovering a bit of conjunctiva.
• Weakness in the dorsal-lumbar line and swaying at the walk.



FCI-St. N° 204 / 24.07.2000
• Loin too elevated, which, although permitted, must never be
exaggerated.

### SEVERE FAUTLS:


• Frail appearance.
• Muzzle too pointed or blunt.
• Moderately overshot mouth; absence of canines or premolars not
due to traumatisms.
• Entropion or ectropion.
• Cropped ears.
• Saddle back.
• Height at the croup much more than the height at the withers.
• Thoracic perimeter insufficient.
• Tail carried too high or resting on the croup; docked tail.
• Incorrect position of the legs; weak or crooked legs.
• Out at the elbows, at the walk or when standing.
• Cow-hocked.
• Lateral movements of the legs when walking.
• Wavy coat, hard or semi-long.
• Depigmentation.
• Unbalanced
temperament,
excessively
timid,
nervous
or
aggressive.

### DISQUALIFYING FAULTS:


• Aggressive or overly shy dogs.
• Any dog clearly showing physical or behavioural abnormalities.
• Length of the body equal or below that of the height at withers.
• Split nose.
• Excessively overshot mouth; undershot bite in any degree.
• Hair hard and long; woolly coat which indicates cross-breeding.
• Tri-coloured dogs or with tan markings on the muzzle and the
legs.
