### CHART POLSKI


(Polish Greyhound)




FCI-St. N° 333  / 01.01.1999


TRANSLATION: Mrs.Peggy Davis.  Official language (DE).

ORIGIN: Poland.

### DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THE OFFICIAL VALID



### STANDARD: 01.10.1999.



UTILIZATION: Hunting dog not only for hare, fox, roe-deer and
bustard, but also for the wolf.

### FCI-CLASSIFICATION:


Group 10 Sighthounds.

Section 3
Short-haired



Sighthounds.

Without working trial.

BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: The presence of the Chart
Polski in Poland is attested since the 13th century; this breed goes
probably back to Asiatic sighthounds of Saluki type.  The Borzoi
being unknown before the reign of Iwan the Terrible during the
XVIth century, it is impossible, as claimed by the Russian author
Sabaniejew, that the Chart Polski would be the result of
interbreeding between the Greyhound and the Borzoi.  The mention
of the Chart Polski in the literature, especially the hunt-literature, is
frequent and the iconographic representations are noticeably
unvarying.  This uniform general appearance in drawings and
paintings proves, that, in spite of different interbreeding, the original
aspect of the breed has remained unchanged up to the end of the
XIXth century.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: The Polish Greyhound is a dog of
great size, powerful, muscular, definitely stronger and less fine in
shape than the other short-haired sighthounds (he must not, however,
be heavy nor lethargic).  In his appearance, he is similar to the
Asiatic greyhound who is his ancestor.




FCI-St. N° 333  / 01.01.1999

The strong frame, the short-coupled body, the distinctly visible
musculature and the powerful jaws show that this dog has been used
for hunting in the difficult conditions of the Polish climate.  The
expressive eyes, with a lively and penetrating look, play an important
role in the general aspect of the Polish Greyhound.

IMPORTANT PROPORTION: The proportion of the length of the
body in relation to the height at the withers should be 10,2-10,3: 10.

BEHAVIOUR / TEMPERAMENT: The Polish Greyhound is selfassured, confident, reserved and brave.  When hunting he is fast,
very skilful and untiring.  In action, he reacts quickly and brutally.

HEAD: Strong, lean and long.
The proportion of the length of head in relation to the height at the
withers is

- in the males  37-39 : 100.

- in the females 36-38 : 100.
The length of the muzzle in relation to the length of the skull is 1 : 1,
but the muzzle may be slightly longer.
The proportion of the width of the head at the zygomatic arches’level
in relation to the length of the head is about 38: 100.
The desirable proportion of the perimeter of the muzzle in front of
the eye sockets in relation to the length of the head is about 80 : 100.

### CRANIAL REGION:


Skull: The upper part of the skull should be flat, the frontal furrow
slightly pronounced and of a desirable depth of 5 mm; frontal bones
and superciliary arches are lightly marked.  The lateral lines of the
skull should blend in perfectly with the lateral lines of the muzzle.
Stop: Naso-frontal depression very lightly marked.

### FACIAL REGION:


Nose: Black or dark, large, projecting above the lips.




FCI-St. N° 333  / 01.01.1999
Muzzle: Strong, tapering towards the nose so gently that it does not
give the impression of being pointed, but of rather being blunt for a
sighthound.  The position of the nose desirably somewhat below the
upper line of the muzzle.  The upper lines of the muzzle and the skull
should be slightly divergent.
Lips : Lips fully defined, clean without excess; in the first part of the
muzzle, they may form a minor fold covering the pigmented borders
of the lower lip, but are never pendulous and do not hide the lower
jaw.
Jaws/Teeth: Jaws and teeth strong.  Scissor bite, pincer bite
acceptable.

EYES: Dark eyes desirable. According to the dog’s coat, the iris is
of a shade going from dark brown to amber colour. Eyes are
expressive, rather large, set slightly oblique (almond-shaped).  The
expression of the eyes must be characteristic: lively and penetrating.

EARS: Of medium size, quite narrow; when laid forward their tips
easily touch the inner angles of the eyes.  Set at eye level.  The
auricle of the ear has a relatively soft cartilage; the ears give the
impression of being quite fleshy.
Admitted ear carriage:
• Folded backwards, touching the neck,
• roof shape position,
• in a state of excitement, ears fully erect, or with the tips slightly
bent forward.

NECK: Long, muscular, powerful, oval in profile, rising gently from
the line of the withers.  Head carriage rather high (the Polish
Greyhound, at rest, carries the head slightly lower than the
Greyhound).

BODY: In the free-standing hound, the height at the withers should
be equal to the height at the summit of the croup.
Withers: Small, but marked.


FCI-St. N° 333  / 01.01.1999
Topline: Straight in the thoracic part, gently arched in the lumbar
region.  In the females an almost straight topline in the lumbar region
is not a fault.
Loin: Wide and muscular.
Croup: Oblique, gently slanting, long, muscular and wide; points of
hip bones wide apart, (the width between the hip bones represents
12-14 % of the height at the withers.)
Chest : Thoracic cage very spacious and well let down (the ideal is a
ribcage reaching the point of the elbow in the sternal region),
moderately wide seen from the front; the ribs should be well sprung
towards the rear, clearly arched but not barrel-shaped.  Long ribs,
placed obliquely in relation to the spinal column.  Sternum long.
Underline and belly: Tucked up.

TAIL: Feathered, long, strong at the base, at rest carried low; the tip
of the tail should be in the shape of a sickle curved upwards or
forming a complete ring.  Sometimes, while at rest, the tail may be
hanging straight down, but never so excessively like a cow’s tail.  On
the move, the tail may be carried higher, but the base of the tail
should not be carried higher than the level of the loin.

### LIMBS



### FOREQUARTERS:


General appearance: Forelegs long, lean, muscular, not too wide
apart; seen from the front parallel.
Forearm: Long; the proportion of the distance from the point of the
elbow to the ground in relation to the height at the withers should be
of about 54% and be balanced so that the hound does not give the
impression of being excessively high on the leg.
Pasterns (Metacarpus): Slightly oblique in relation to the ground.
Forefeet: Oval; toes tight, well arched.

### HINDQUARTERS:


General appearance: Long, muscular, quite well angulated, slightly
standing towards the back and set slightly wide, but definitely less so
than in the Greyhound.  Seen from behind, the legs should be
parallel.


FCI-St. N° 333  / 01.01.1999
Lower thigh: Long.
Hock joint: Strong.
Hind feet: Oval, slightly longer than the front feet; toes tight,
compact.

GAIT / MOVEMENT: The movement must be flowing and
energetic; the appropriate angulation of the fore- and hindquarters
allow an extension of the leg forward in a long and ground covering
stride at the walk as well as at the trot.  The sighthounds led slowly
may pace, but with acceleration of the speed, they should get back to
the normal diagonal movement. The action of the hind legs is one of
the characteristics; they can be placed on a single straight line while
on a slow trot, which is not a fault.

SKIN: Well fitting, elastic.

### COAT


Hair: Coat springy to the touch, rather harsh, not « wired-haired » but
not silky either.  Of variable lengths over all the body.  On the
withers the coat may be longer, shorter on the sides; it is on the
sternum and the legs where it is the shortest.  The hair on the
abdomen is more delicate, more sparse.  At the buttock and along the
whole underside of the tail the hair is longest but still also harsh,
forming modest breeches and a brush.

Colour: All colours are permitted.  Border of the eyelids and nose
black or dark; when the colour of the coat is lighter, i.e. blue or
beige, the nose is in relation blue or beige.

SIZE: The ideal size


for the female is of 68 - 75 cm at the withers,


for the male    is of 70 - 80 cm at the withers.
Subjects bigger than the ideal size are permitted, with the condition
that the typical morphology is maintained.  A slightly smaller size
than that given in the standard is, however, not an eliminating fault
if, apart from that, the hound does not show any other faults.




FCI-St. N° 333  / 01.01.1999


FAULTS : Any departure from the foregoing points should be
considered a fault and the seriousness with which the fault should be
regarded should be in exact proportion to its degree and its effect
upon the health and welfare of the dog.

### GENERAL APPEARANCE:


• Severe departure from the required relation between height at
withers and length of the body.
• Fragile bone structure, weakness.
• Weak musculature or heaviness.

### HEAD:


• Frontal part too convex.
• Frontal furrow too defined.
• Stop too pronounced.
• Nose fine, pointed.
• Nasal bridge too convex.
• Flews excessively developed.
• Weak jaws.  Overshot- or undershot mouth; important absence of
teeth (with the exception of PM 1).
• Protruding eyes.
• Ears flat touching sides of the head.

### NECK:


• Short, fine; exaggerated high head carriage or exaggerated low
head carriage.

### BODY:


• Back arching already from the thoracic vertebrae onwards.
• Lumbar region too convex.
• Ribcage flat, not enough let down.  Sternum short, manubrium of
the sternum receding so much that, when looking in profile, it is
not visible behind the edge of the shoulder.




FCI-St. N° 333  / 01.01.1999


### TAIL:


• Completely curved over the back or carried sideways.

### FOREQUARTERS:
