FCI-St. N° 263 / 12.03.1999

### STANDARD: 14.02.1995.



UTILIZATION: Retriever equally proficient on land and in the
water.

### FCI-CLASSIFICATION:


Group 8
Retrievers-Flushing


Dogs-Water Dogs.

Section 1    Retrievers.

With working trial.

GENERAL APPEARANCE : Equally  proficient on land and in the
water, the Chesapeake Bay  Retriever was  developed along  the
Chesapeake Bay  to hunt waterfowl  under the most  adverse weather
and water  conditions, often having to break ice during the course of
many strenuous multiple retrieves.   Frequently the Chesapeake must
face wind, tide and long cold swims in its work.  The breed's
characteristics are specifically suited to enable the Chesapeake to
function with ease, efficiency and endurance.  In head, the
Chesapeake's skull is broad and round with a medium stop.  The jaws
should be of sufficient length and strength to carry large game birds
with an easy, tender hold.  The double coat consists of a short, harsh,
wavy outer coat and a dense, fine, wooly undercoat containing an
abundance of natural oil and is ideally suited for the icy rugged
conditions of weather the Chesapeake often works in.   In body, the
Chesapeake  is a strong, well-balanced,  powerfully built animal of
moderate  size and medium length in body and leg, deep and wide in
chest,  the shoulders built with full liberty of movement, and with  no
tendency  to weakness  in any  feature, particularly  the rear.  The
power though, should not be at the expense of agility or stamina.
Size and substance should not be excessive as this is a working
retriever of an active nature.



FCI-St. N° 263 / 12.03.1999
Distinctive features include eyes that are very clear, of yellowish or
amber hue, hindquarters as high or a trifle higher than the shoulders,
and a double coat which tends to wave on shoulders, neck, back and
loins only.

IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS: Height from the top of the
shoulder blades to the ground should be slightly less than the body
length from the breastbone to the point of buttocks.  Depth of body
should extend at least to the elbow.  Shoulder to elbow and elbow to
ground should be equal.

BEHAVIOUR/TEMPERAMENT: The Chesapeake is valued for
its bright and happy disposition, intelligence, quiet good sense, and
affectionate protective nature. Courage, willingness to work,
alertness, nose, intelligence, love of water, general quality and, most
of all, disposition should be given primary consideration in the
selection and breeding of the Chesapeake Bay Retriever.
Extreme shyness or extreme aggressive tendencies are not desirable
in the breed either as a gun dog or companion.

### HEAD:



### CRANIAL REGION:


Skull: Broad and round.
Stop: Medium stop.

### FACIAL REGION:


Nose: Medium short.
Muzzle:  Approximately the same length as the skull, tapering
pointed but not sharp.
Lips: Thin, not pendulous.
Jaws/Teeth: Scissors bite is preferred, but a level bite is acceptable.

EYES: Are to be medium large, very clear, of yellowish or amber
color and wide apart. Intelligent expression.

EARS: Are to be small, set well up on the head, hanging loosely, and
of medium leather.


FCI-St. N° 263 / 12.03.1999

NECK: Should be of medium length with a strong muscular
appearance, tapering to the shoulders.

BODY:  Of medium length, neither cobby nor roached, but rather
approaching hollowness from underneath as the flanks should be
well tucked up.
Topline:  Should show the hindquarters to be as high as or a trifle
higher than the shoulders.
Back: Short, well coupled and powerful.
Chest: Strong, deep and wide.   Rib cage barrel, round and deep.

TAIL: Of medium length; medium heavy at the base.  The tail
should be straight or slightly curved and should not curl over back or
side kink.

### LIMBS



### FOREQUARTERS:


General appearance: There should be no tendency to weakness in the
forequarters.  They are medium in length and straight, showing good
bone and muscle.  The front legs should appear straight when viewed
from front or rear.
Shoulder: Should be sloping with full liberty of action, plenty of
power and without any restrictions of movement.
Pastern: Slightly bent and of medium length.  Dewclaws may be
removed.
Forefeet: Well webbed harefeet, of good size with toes well-rounded
and close.


### HINDQUARTERS:


General appearance: Good hindquarters are essential.  They should
show fully as much power as the forequarters.  There should be no
tendency to weakness in the hindquarters.   Hindquarters should be
especially powerful to supply the driving power for swimming.  Legs
should be medium length and straight, showing good bone and
muscle.


FCI-St. N° 263 / 12.03.1999
The hind legs should look straight when viewed from the front or
rear.   Dewclaws, if any, must be removed from the hind legs.
Stifle: Well angulated.
Hock: The distance from hock to ground should be of medium
length.
Hind feet: Well webbed harefeet, of good size with toes wellrounded and close.


GAIT / MOVEMENT:  The gait should be smooth, free and
effortless, giving the impression of great power and strength.   When
viewed from the side, there should be good reach with no restrictions
of movement in the front and plenty of drive in the rear, with good
flexion of the stifle and hock joints.  Coming at you, there should be
no sign of elbows being out.  When the Chesapeake is moving away
from you, there should be no sign of cow-hockness from the rear.  As
speed increases, the feet tend to converge toward a center line of
gravity.

### COAT:


Hair: Coat should be thick and short, nowhere over 1 1/2 inches (4
cm) long, with a dense, fine, woolly undercoat.  Hair on the face and
legs should be very short and straight with a tendency to wave on the
shoulders, neck, back and loins only. Moderate feathering on rear of
hindquarters and tail is permissible.  The texture of the Chespeake's
coat is very important, as the Chesapeake is used for hunting under
all sorts of adverse weather conditions, often working in ice and
snow.  The oil in the harsh outer coat and woolly undercoat is of
extreme value in preventing the cold water from reaching the
Chesapeake's skin and aids in quick drying.  A Chesapeake's coat
should resist the water in the same way that a duck's feathers do.
When the Chesapeake leaves the water and shakes, the coat should
not hold water at all, being merely moist.

Colour: The colour of the Chesapeake Bay Retriever must be as
nearly that of its working surroundings as possible.  Any colour of
brown, sedge or deadgrass is acceptable, self-coloured Chesapeakes
being preferred.


FCI-St. N° 263 / 12.03.1999
One colour is not to be preferred over another.  A white spot on the
breast, belly, toes, or back of the feet (immediately above the large
pad) is permissible, but the smaller the spot the better, solid coloured
preferred.   The colour of the coat and its texture must be given every
consideration when judging on the bench or in the ring.  Honorable
scars are not to be penalized.

### SIZE AND WEIGHT:


Height at the withers:
Males should measure    23 to 26 inches; (58 - 66cm).
Females should measure 21 to 24 inches; (53 - 61cm).
Oversized or undersized animals are to be severely penalized.

Weight: Males should weigh 65 to 80 pounds (29,5-36,5kg); females
should weigh 55 to 70 pounds (25-32kg).

FAULTS : Any departure from the foregoing points should be
considered a fault and the seriousness with which the fault should be
regarded should be in exact proportion to its degree and its effect
upon the health and welfare of the dog.

### DISQUALYFING FAULTS:


• Aggressive or overly shy.
• Any dog clearly showing physical or behavioural abnormalities.
• Specimens lacking   in    breed characteristics.
• Teeth overshot or undershot.
• Declaws on the hind legs.
• Coat curly or with a tendency to curl all over the body.
• Feathering on the tail or legs over 1 3/4 inches (4,5 cm) long.
• Black coloured.
• White on any part of the body except breast, belly, toes, or back
of feet.




FCI-St. N° 263 / 12.03.1999
The question of the coat and general type of balance takes
precedence over any scoring table which could be drawn up. The
Chesapeake should be well proportioned, an animal with a good coat
and well balanced in other points being preferable to one excelling in
some but weak in others.

• Head, including lips, ears and eyes
• Neck
• Shoulders and body
• Hindquarters and stifles
• Elbows, legs and feet
• Colour
