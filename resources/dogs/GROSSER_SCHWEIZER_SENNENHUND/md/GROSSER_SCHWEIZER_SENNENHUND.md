BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY:  In 1908, at Langenthal, on
the occasion of the jubilee show to mark 25 years of existence of the
“Schweizerische Kynologische Gesellschaft” (Swiss Kennel Club)
SKG, two short-haired Bernese Mountain Dogs were presented to the
great promotor of the Swiss Mountain Dogs, Prof. Albert Heim.  He
recognized them to be representatives of the old, vanishing, large
Mountain Dog or butcher’s dog, whose ancestors had in the past
been widely spread across Europe, bred as guard-, draught- or
droving-cattle dogs.  In 1909 they were recognized by the SKG as a
separate breed being registered in volume 12 of the Swiss Stud Book.
In 1912, the club for “Grosse Schweizer Sennenhunde” was founded
in order to promote this breed and keep it purebred.  The first
standard was published by the FCI not before February 5th, 1939.
Today these dogs are also bred in other European countries, they are
especially appreciated as family dogs due to their calm, reliable
temperament.
