With working trial.

BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: Its direct ancestor is the old
Roman Molossian. Formerly scattered all over Italy, in the recent past,
the breed was only prevalent in the province of Apulia and in the
adjacent regions of Southern Italy. His name derives from the Latin
“cohors”, which means “protector, guardian of the farmyard”.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: Medium to large sized. Robust and
sturdy dog, nevertheless with some elegance. Lean and powerful
muscles.

IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS: The dog is rectangular in outline
and is slightly longer than tall. (The length of the dog is 11% greater
than the height of the dog). The length of the head reaches 36 % of the
height at the withers.

BEHAVIOUR/TEMPERAMENT: Guardian of property, family
and livestock; extremely agile and responsive. In the past, it has been
used for herding cattle and hunting big game.

of the skull and the muzzle are slightly convergent, without evident
wrinkles.

Convex in front, it becomes flat behind the forehead as far as the

lateral surfaces are parallel; the muzzle is as broad as it is long. Seen
from the side it is deep. The profile of the nasal bridge is straight.
Lips: The upper lips; seen from the front, form an inverted ”U” at their
meeting point; seen from the side hangs moderately. They cover the
lower jaw and determine the profile of the lower part of the muzzle.
Jaws/Teeth: Jaws are very large thick and curved. Slightly undershot
but no more than 5 mm. Level bite tolerable but not sought after.
Cheeks: The masseter region is fully evident, but not bulging.

EYES: Medium-sized, slightly protruding, but never exaggerated.

position. Eyelids close fitting. The colour of the iris is as dark as
possible but according to the coat colour. Expression is keen and
attentive.

EARS: Triangular, drooping, of medium size. With a wide set-on that
is much above the zygomatic arches. Ears are un-cropped.
