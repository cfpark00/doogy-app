### BRAQUE D’AUVERGNE


(Auvergne Pointer)




FCI-St. N° 180  / 02.04.2004
TRANSLATION: John Miller and Raymond Triquet.  Official
language (FR).

ORIGIN: France.

### DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THE  OFFICIAL VALID



### STANDARD: 24.03.2004.



UTILIZATION: Pointing breed.

### FCI-CLASSIFICATION:


Group 7
Pointing Dogs.

Section 1.1. Continental Pointing



Dogs – Type “Braque”.

With Working Trial.



BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: The Auvergne pointer is a
very ancient breed, present in the Cantal region for more than two
centuries.  Descending from a multi-pointer common source,
derivation has been made by a selection to which the Knights of
Malta might have participated.  Created by and for hunters, it has a
strong identity reinforced by its coat.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: Rectilinear, of medium proportions.
Robust dog, strongly boned, but without heaviness, showing a
characteristic Braque type, lightness in its gait, with elegance
enhanced by the coat and harmonious proportions.  Its conformation
predisposes it to cover long distances with a supple-action,
permitting it to maintain its activity the whole day on the most
difficult terrains.

### IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS:


• Body: The length of the body (from the point of the
shoulder to thepoint of the buttock) is approximately equal
to the height at the withers.The depth of the chest equals
half the height of the dog at the withers.
• Head: Length of the muzzle slightly less or equal to the
length ofthe skull.


FCI-St. N° 180  / 02.04.2004

BEHAVIOUR / TEMPERAMENT: Gentle dog, very affectionate,
intelligent and obedient.  Its training consists mainly of developing
its natural qualities.  Its sense of smell is powerful.  It adapts well to
family life.

### HEAD



### CRANIAL REGION:


Skull and muzzle: The lines of the skull are slightly divergent
towards the front (a characterized braque).
The head is long, proportional to the size, somewhat lighter with the
females.
Seen from above, the shape of the skull is nearly oval.  The occipital
protuberance is only slightly prominent.
The skull width between the zygomatic arches is equal to its length.
Superciliary arches: Well pronounced.
Stop: Moderately marked.

### FACIAL REGION:


Nose: Always black, relatively broad, shiny, with well-open nostrils.
Its upper profile is in prolongation of that of the muzzle.
Muzzle: Length close to that of the skull.  The muzzle is level.
Lips : Relatively important. The upper lip overlaps the lower.  Neat
commissure, without important inner fold.  Seen from the front, the
lips form a square end to the muzzle.
Jaws/Teeth:  Sturdy, of equal length.  The teeth are strong.  Scissors
bite or level bite.

EYES: Relatively large, oval, of dark hazel colour, well set in the
orbit, giving an expressive candid and kind look.
The well pigmented eyelid does not allow the conjunctiva to be seen.

EARS:  Attached rather towards the rear.  At rest, the ear is set
below a line running from the upper level of the nose to the eye.
When attentive, the ear may move up to that line.  Turned slightly
inward, neither curled nor flat, the ear is supple and slightly satiny.


FCI-St. N° 180  / 02.04.2004
The tip is fairly round.  Drawn forward, it should reach the root of
the nose, without going further than the tip.

NECK: Relatively long, well inserted between the shoulders, slightly
arched.  Presence of a slight dewlap.  The length of the neck is
roughly equal to that of the head.

### BODY:


Topline : Straight and taut.
Withers: Marked.
Back: Narrow, flat and short.  The spinal column isn’t sprung out.
Loin: Well attached, wide (especially in females), very slightly
convex.
Croup: Oblique (35° with respect to the dorsal line), points of hips
visible.
Chest: Long and deep, reaching elbow level.  A transversal section is
egg shaped, regularly sprung, without rupture in the lower part.
Underline and Belly: Rises gently towards the belly, not whippety.
The flank is wide, only slightly hollowed, joined smoothly to the
hips.

TAIL: Set rather high.  It should be carried horizontally.  Cylindrical
and not too fine.  Docked, it has a length of 15 to 20 cm (6” to 8”).
Undocked, it reaches the point of the hocks without going further.

LIMBS: They are in line with the body.

### FOREQUARTERS:


General appearance: Upright to the ground.
Shoulder: Strong, well muscled, quite free in action.  Sloping at 45°.
Elbow: Well in the axis of the body.
Forearm: Strong and long, muscular and straight.
Carpus (Carpal joint) : Strong without knots.
Metacarpus (Pastern) : Short, slightly inclined seen in profile.
Forefeet: A little longer than what’s called a « cat food » and a little
shorter than a « hare foot ».  Turned neither inward nor outward.
The nails are strong and short; the pads are hard and resistant; the
toes are tightly knit.


FCI-St. N° 180  / 02.04.2004


### HINDQUARTERS:


General appearance: Well angled, they work in parallel planes.
Upper thigh: Well muscled.
Hock: Lean and well defined.
Metatarsus (Rear pastern): Short and never too thin.
Hind feet: A little longer than what’s called a « cat food » and a little
shorter than a « hare foot ».  Turned neither inward nor outward.
The nails are strong and short; the pads are hard and resistant; the
toes are tightly knit.

GAIT / MOVEMENT: Movement of average amplitude but with a
sustained rhythm which confers its notorious endurance to the dog.
Its habitual hunting gait is an average gallop, regular and slightly
rocking.

SKIN: Fine enough, rather loose without exaggeration.

### COAT


Hair: Short, not too fine, never hard, shiny.

Colour: Black with white markings of variable importance.
The particularity of the marking generates two recognized types :
Flecked or Greying.  This difference cannot be used to separate two
subjects of the same quality.
The head should be black preferably with a white blaze on the
muzzle extending to the skull.  The white of that blaze can extend
laterally on the muzzle.
A white and flecked ear or the side of the head white and flecked
cannot be considered as faults.

### SIZE:


Height at withers (with for both sexes a tolerance of + 2 cm and
– 1 cm):
Males:      57 to 63 cm (22.5" to 24.8") (60 cm – 23.6" – ideal
height).


FCI-St. N° 180  / 02.04.2004
Females:  53 to 59 cm (20.9" to 23.2") (56 cm – 22 "   – ideal
height).


FAULTS : Any departure from the foregoing points should be
considered a fault and the seriousness with which the fault should be
regarded should be in exact proportion to its degree and its effect
upon the health and welfare of the dog.
•
Parallel lines of skull and muzzle.
•
Head too loaded under the eyes.
•
Apparent conjunctiva.

### SEVERE FAULTS:


•
Convergent lines of muzzle and skull (towards the front).
•
Concave or convex muzzle.
•

the end.

abnormalities.
Head:
•
Lack of “braque”type.
•
Undershot or overshot with more than 1mm gap between
the incisive arcades.
•
Lack of first premolars is tolerated.  The lack of 2 other
premolars (PM2 or PM3) or of any other tooth including
PM4 is eliminatory.
•
Eversion or inversion of eyelids or traces of corrective
intervention.
Leg:
•
Presence of dewclaws or traces of their removal.
Coat:
•
Entirely black or entirely white.

and – 1 cm).

### N.B.:


•      Male animals should have two apparently normal testicles
fully descended into the scrotum.
•      Only functionally and clinically healthy dogs, with breed
typical conformation should be used for breeding.
