BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: It is claimed that the
Bedlington can boast a longer traceable pedigree than any other
terrier and once was known as the Rothbury Terrier, hailing from the
former mining areas of the north of England. His fame spread outside
his native region and an association was started for the breed in


## 1877. Although his expression is mild he is quite capable of fending


for himself, but will not seek a scrap. He is a tough little dog, this
unique breed has a lamb-like look about it, but don’t be fooled, and
he is a terrier through and through. A North Country dog, originally
his role was to catch rabbits for the family pot, and a sporting dog he
still remains.

no signs of either weakness or coarseness. Whole head pear or
wedge-shaped, and expression in repose mild and gentle.

BEHAVIOUR AND TEMPERAMENT: Spirited and game, full of
confidence. An intelligent companion with strong sporting instincts.
