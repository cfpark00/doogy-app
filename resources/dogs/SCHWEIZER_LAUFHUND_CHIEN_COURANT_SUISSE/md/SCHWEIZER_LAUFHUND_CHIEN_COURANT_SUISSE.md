BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: The Swiss Hound has very
ancient origins.  His presence in times of the Roman Helvetia is
certified on a mosaic, discovered at Avenches, by the representation
of packhounds corresponding to the varieties of Swiss hounds.  In the
XVth century, he was sought after by Italian dog lovers and in the
XVIIIth century, by the French, for his exceptional aptitude for
hunting the hare.  His native lines have certainly been influenced by
scenthounds of French breeding brought back to Switzerland by
mercenaries.  In 1882, a standard was established for each of the five
varieties of the Swiss Hound.  In 1909, those standards were revised
and the total disappearance of the hound of Thurgovie was noted.
On 22nd of January 1933, one single standard was established for the
4 varieties of the Swiss Hound.  The ancient variety, the hound of the
Jura type St. Hubert, has in the meantime disappeared.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: Medium size, good conformation
indicating strength and endurance; lean head and long muzzle with
long leathers giving an air of nobility.
