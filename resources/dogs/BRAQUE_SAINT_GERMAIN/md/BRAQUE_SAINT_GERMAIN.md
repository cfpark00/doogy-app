### With Working Trial



BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: It is a descendant of dogs
obtained by crossing an English pointer with a Continental pointer.
The breed was created around 1830 in the royal kennels at
Compiègne, then in Saint Germain en Laye.
This dog was in great vogue until the beginning of the 20th century
and was the most shown pointing breed in the first dog shows,
notably at the first French dog show of 1863.
The French breed club was created in March 1913.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: A breed of medium general
proportions with planes of the head and of the muzzle parallel, or
very slightly divergent, and with a moderately marked stop.
The bone is relatively heavy, the muscular system adapted to work
requiring endurance.
The coat is fawn and white in colour, without any black being
present.
In action, its quest is of average range and its gallop regular and
supple.




FCI-St. N° 115 / 19.09.2023
BEHAVIOUR / TEMPERAMENT: Hunter above all, it is very
sociable, equable and affectionate and won’t suffer brusque
treatment during its training. Everything considered, it is easy to
train.
It hunts with passion pheasant, partridge and woodcock on any
terrain, retrieving with a soft mouth.
Very close to man, it appreciates living with the family.

### HEAD



### CRANIAL REGION:


Skull: Slightly rounded, ogival at the rear, with a prominent occipital
protuberance. The zygomatic arch is hardly emphasized.
Stop: Not too pronounced.

### FACIAL REGION:


Nose: Broad, with well-open nostrils, dark pink in colour.
Muzzle: Bridge of the nose straight or very slightly convex; muzzle
of the same length as the skull.
Lips: They completely cover the lower jaw; they are relatively fine
and devoid of black spots.
Jaws/Teeth: The jaws are sturdy, of equal length; the teeth are large,
well aligned. Scissors bite.
Palate: Devoid of black.

EYES: Well open, relatively large, golden-yellow in colour, well set
in the orbits; the look is candid and mild.

EARS: Set on level with the eye, not too long. The pinna presents a
longitudinal crease. They are rounded at their extremities and are
slightly detached from the head.

NECK: Muscled, relatively long, somewhat arched, a very slight
dewlap is tolerated.

### BODY:


Back: Horizontal.
Loin: Relatively short, broad and sturdy.


FCI-St. N° 115 / 19.09.2023
Croup: Slightly slanting.
Chest: Long, deep and broad. The point of the sternum is slightly
protruding. The ribs are long and well sprung.
Underline and belly: Slightly tucked-up and joining the chest
progressively, without rupture. The chest being long, the flank is
short.

TAIL: Set relatively low, it doesn’t reach further than the point of
the hock, is thick at the beginning and terminates in a point; in
action, it is carried horizontally

LIMBS: Good bone, at rest the muscles are discernable under the
skin.

### FOREQUARTERS:


Shoulder: Long, oblique, muscled, as suits a galloper
Arm: Slightly sloping
Forearm: Strong, muscular, vertical.
Metacarpus (Pastern): Short, very slightly sloping seen in profile.
Foot: Long, toes tight, toenails very light in colour, even white, pads
firm.

### HINDQUARTERS:


General appearance: Limbs well poised when seen from behind.
Thigh: Long and muscled.
Lower Thigh: Well muscled.
Hock: Broad and in the axis of the body.
Metatarsus (rear pastern): Short, vertical, dry.
Foot: Identical to the forefoot.

GAIT/MOVEMENT: The normal gait is the gallop; it should be
supple, balanced and capable of being maintained; its reach is
average.
At any gait, the head is carried slightly above the topline, never
lower.
The Saint Germain pointer covers ground well, whatever the gait.
