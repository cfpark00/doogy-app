### BLACK AND TAN COONHOUND




FCI-St. N° 300  /  04.10.2002


### ORIGIN: USA.



### DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THE OFFICIAL VALID



### STANDARD: 30.01.1991.



UTILIZATION: Hound.

### FCI-CLASSIFICATION:


Group 6      Scent hounds and related


breeds.

Section 1     Large-sized hounds.

Without working trial.

GENERAL  APPEARANCE :  The  Black  and  Tan Coonhound  is
first  and fundamentally a  working  dog,  a trail  and  tree  hound,
capable  of withstanding  the  rigors of  winter,  the  heat of  summer,
and  the difficult  terrain  over  which he  is  called  upon to  work.
Used principally for trailing and treeing raccoon, the Black and Tan
Coonhound runs his game entirely by scent.  The characteristics and
courage of the Coonhound also make him proficient on the hunt for
deer, bear, mountain lion and other big game.  Judges are asked by
the club sponsoring the breed to place great emphasis upon these
facts when evaluating the merits of the dog.  The general impression
is that of power, agility and alertness.   He immediately impresses
one with his ability to cover the ground with powerful rhythmic
strides.  Considering their job as a hunting dog, the individual should
exhibit moderate bone and good muscle tone.  Males are heavier in
bone and muscle tone than females.

### IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS:


• Measured from the point of shoulder to the buttocks and from
withers to ground the length of body is equal to or slightly greater
than the height of the dog at the withers.
• Height is in proportion to general conformation so that the dog
appears neither leggy nor close to the ground.




FCI-St. N° 300  /  04.10.2002
BEHAVIOUR/ TEMPERAMENT: Even temperament, outgoing
and friendly.   As a working scent hound, must be able to work in
close contact with other hounds.  Some may be reserved but never
shy or vicious.  Aggression toward people or other dogs is most
undesirable.

HEAD: The head is cleanly modelled.  From the back of the skull to
the nose the head measures from 9 to 10 inches in males and from 8
to 9 inches in females.
Expression:  Is alert, friendly and eager.  The skin is devoid of folds.

### CRANIAL REGION:


Skull   Tends toward oval outline.  Viewed from profile the line of
the skull is on a practically parallel plane to the foreface or muzzle.
Stop: Medium stop occurring midway between occiput bone and
nose.

### FACIAL REGION:


Nose: Nostrils well open and always black.
Flews: The flews are well developed with typical hound appearance.
Teeth: Fit evenly with scissors bite.

EYES: Are from hazel to dark brown in colour, almost round and
not
deeply set.

EARS: Are low set and well back.  They hang in graceful folds,
giving
the dog a majestic appearance.  In length they extend naturally well
beyond the tip of the nose and are set at eye level or lower.

NECK: The neck is muscular, sloping, medium length.  The skin is
devoid of excess dewlap.

### BODY:


Back:  The back is level, powerful and strong.
Chest: Chest reaches at least to the elbows.


FCI-St. N° 300  /  04.10.2002
Ribs:  The dog possesses full, round, well sprung ribs, avoiding
flatsidedness.

TAIL: Is strong, with base slightly below level of backline,
carried free and when in action at approximately right angle to back.

### LIMBS:



### FOREQUARTERS:


General appearance: The forelegs are straight
.
Shoulder: Powerfully constructed.
Elbow: Turning neither in nor out.
Pastern: Strong and erect.
Forefeet:  Are compact, with well knuckled, strongly arched toes and
thick, strong pads.


### HINDQUARTERS:


General appearance: Quarters are well boned and muscled.   From
hip to hock long and sinewy, hock to pad short and strong. When
standing on a level surface, the hind feet are set back from under the
body and the leg from pad to hock is at right angles to the ground.
Stifles and hocks: Well bent and not inclining either in or out.
Hind feet:  Are compact, with well knuckled, strongly arched toes
and thick, strong pads.

GAIT:  When viewed from the side, the stride of the Black and Tan
Coonhound is easy and graceful with plenty of reach in front and
drive behind.  When viewed from the front the forelegs, which are in
line with the width of the body, move forward in an effortless
manner, but never cross.  Viewed from the rear the hocks follow on a
line with the forelegs, being neither too  widely nor too closely
spaced, and as the speed of the trot  increases the feet tend to
converge toward a center line or single track  indicating soundness,
balance and stamina.  When in action, his head and tail carriage is
proud and alert; the topline remains level.




FCI-St. N° 300  /  04.10.2002


### COAT


Hair : Short but dense to withstand rough going.

Colour:  As the name implies, the colour is coal black with rich tan
markings above eyes, on sides of muzzle, chest, legs and breeching,
with black pencil markings on toes.

### SIZE:


Measured at the shoulder: Males    63, 5 to 68,5 cm (25 to 27 ins);
Females  58     to 63, 5 cm (23 to 25 ins).
Oversized dogs should not be penalized when general soundness and
proportion are in favour.

FAULTS : Any departure from the foregoing points should be
considered a fault and the seriousness with which the fault should be
regarded should be in exact proportion to its degree and its effect
upon the health and welfare of the dog.

• Eyes: Yellow or light eyes.
• Ears: Ears that do not reach the tip of nose and are set too high on
the head.

wounds shall not be considered faults.
