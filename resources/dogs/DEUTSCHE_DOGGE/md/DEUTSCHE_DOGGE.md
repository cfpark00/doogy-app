Mastiff type.

Without working trial.

BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: As forerunners of the present
day Great Dane, one must look at the old “Bullenbeisser” (Bulldog) as
well as the « Hatz-and Saurüden » (Hunting and wild boar hounds),
which were midway between the strong Mastiff of English type and
the fast, handy Greyhound. The term Dogge was at first understood to
mean a large, powerful dog, not of any particular breed.  Later,
particular names such as Ulmer Dogge, English Dogge, Great Dane,
Hatzrüde (Hunting Dog), Saupacker (boarfinder) and Grosse Dogge
(Great Dogge), classified these dogs according to colour and size.
In the year 1878 a Committee of seven was formed in Berlin,
consisting of active breeders and judges with Dr. Bodinus in the chair,
which made the decision to classify all the forenamed varieties as
“Deutsche Doggen” (Great Danes). Thus the foundation was laid for
the breeding of a separate German breed.
In the year 1880, on the occasion of a show in Berlin, the first standard
for the Deutsche Dogge was laid down.


FCI-St. N° 235 / 02.10.2024

This standard has been taken care of since the year 1888 by
the “Deutsche Doggen Club 1888 e.V.” (German Doggen Club,
registered Club 1888) and frequently been revised over the years. The
present Standard meets the requirements of the F.C.I.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: The Great Dane in his noble
appearance combines a large, powerful well constructed body with
pride, strength and elegance. By substance together with nobility,
harmonious appearance, well proportioned outlines, as well as an
especially expressive head, the Great Dane strikes the onlooker as a
noble statue, never coarse or with refined elegance. Perfect in balance
and always with clearly defined sexual dimorphism. He is the Apollo
amongst all breeds.

IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS: Almost square in build, this
applies particularly to males. Females can be a little longer in body.

BEHAVIOUR/TEMPERAMENT: Friendly, loving and devoted to
his owners. Might be reserved towards strangers, but required is a
confident, fearless, easily tractable, docile companion and family dog
with high resistance to provocation and without aggression. Socially
acceptable behaviour is of the utmost importance.

HEAD: In harmony with the general appearance. Long, narrow,
distinct and expressive. Never wedge shaped. Finely chiselled,
especially under the eyes. The distance from tip of nose to stop and
from stop to the slightly defined occipital bone should be as equal as
possible: Ratio 1:1. The upper lines of muzzle and skull should
definitely run parallel. The head must appear narrow and angular
seen from the front with bridge of nose as broad as possible.

### CRANIAL REGION:


Top skull must be flat and angular.
Skull: Superciliary ridges well developed but not protruding.
Stop: Clearly defined.

patches). In these a black nose is desired but a butterfly nose (black
with pink patches) or flesh coloured nose is tolerated. In blue dogs the
colour of the nose is anthracite (diluted black).

never be concave (dish shaped), convex (roman nose) or falling away
in front part (eagle nose).

patches) pale (ice blue) eyes or two differently coloured eyes are to
be tolerated.
