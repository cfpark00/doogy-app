type.

Without working trial.

BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: In the middle of the
nineteenth century it was very popular amongst the upper middle
classes in the Netherlands to follow horse and carriage and to catch
rats in the stables. Although the origin of the breed is uncertain it is
generally believed that the yellow Schnauzer was one of the original
dogs in the creation of the breed. A dog dealer in Amsterdam sold
these dogs as ‘Gentleman’s stable dogs’ to visitors of the Amsterdam
commodity exchange. Soon the name changed into ‘Smous’ i.e.
rough bearded. This was to distinguish it from the Brussels Griffon.
The first Standard dates back to 1905; it was drawn up by Messrs.
H.A. Earl of Bylandt, A. Woltman Elpers and L. Seegers. After a
long period in which popularity and decreasing public interest took
turns, the last litter was registered in the Dutch Stud book,
Nederlands Honden Stamboek (N.H.S.B.) in 1949. In 1973 Mrs
H.M. Barkman van der Weel took the initiative to reconstruct the
breed. She started with crossbreeds that looked like the Dutch
Smousdog.

Since 1978 the interests of the Hollandse Smoushond is protected by
the Hollandse Smoushonden Club. In 1980 the 1905 standard was
revised.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: Rough coated, lively, active, strong
and squarely built. Compact and sturdy. Bitches are allowed slightly
more length of body.

### IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS:


Height at the withers preferably equal to physical length of body.
The relation between length of the skull, from occipital bone to stop,
and length of the muzzle, from stop to tip of nose, is 2:1.
The depth of chest is about half of the height at the withers.

### BEHAVIOUR/TEMPERAMENT:


The
Dutch
Smoushond
is
affectionate, gay, friendly and free spirited by nature, has a lively
disposition but is not nervously over-active, nor easily frightened.

### HEAD


The head is broad and shortish with a distinct stop. The garnishing is
very characteristic.

### CRANIAL REGION:


Skull: Broad and shortish, slightly domed.
Stop: Distinct.

### FACIAL REGION:


Nose: Preferably black and broad.
Muzzle: Broad. The length of the muzzle is preferably half the length
of the distance stop-occipital bone. Bridge of the nose straight.
Lips: Tight with black rims.
Jaws/Teeth: Preferably a scissors bite.  A pincer bite (edge to edge)
or just slightly undershot mouth is not considered as faulty.

EYES: The dark brown eyes are very typical of the breed, they have
a friendly and lively expression and they are large and round, neither
bulging nor deep-set.


FCI-St. N°308 / 16.03.2012

EARS: The ears are rather high-set, relatively small and drooping.  When
the dog is alert, the points of the ears lean a little forward against the
cheeks.

NECK: Rather short and muscular.

BODY: The body must give an impression of sturdiness.
Top line: The neck line runs smoothly into the upper line of the
body.
Back: Straight.
Loin: Slightly arched.
Croup: Slightly sloping.
Chest: Gives a broad impression, not unduly deep and with well
sprung ribs. Forechest not very pronounced.
Underline and belly: The belly is slightly tucked-up.

TAIL: The tail is rather short, preferably no longer than reaching to the hock
joint, carried gaily but not curled over the back.

### LIMBS

FCI-St. N°308 / 16.03.2012

Metatarsus (Rear pastern): No dewclaws.
Hind feet: Round, neat and small (cat-feet.) Dark nails are preferred.

GAIT / MOVEMENT: An easy, supple and regular gait.

### COAT


Hair: Hair on the body is coarse, wiry, harsh, straight and with an
unkempt look about it, approx. 4-7 cms long with a sufficient
undercoat.  Curly or woolly coat and tendencies to mat are
undesirable. Hair on the head is preferably of the same wiry texture
as on the body. The hair is longer on the cheeks and forms
moustaches, beard and eyebrows. The eyebrows may drop a little
over the eyes as long as they do not hide the eyes or interfere with
the sight. The legs are covered with the same textured hair as on the
body though slightly shorter. The hair on legs is pointing backwards,
thus suggesting a slight feathering; no dense or woolly coat must
cover the legs, thus hiding the true outline.  The hair on the tail is
bushy all over.

Colour: Self-coloured yellow in any shades with a preference for a
dark straw colour. Ears, moustaches, beard and eyebrows may be of
a darker nuance of yellow. Any other colour than yellow is
undesirable.

### SIZE AND WEIGHT:


Height at the withers:
Males:    approx. 37-42 cms.



Females: approx. 35-40 cms.
Weight: The weight varies between 7 - 11 kgs.



FAULTS: Any departure from the foregoing points should be considered
a fault and the seriousness with which the fault should be regarded should
be in exact proportion to its degree and its effect upon the health and
welfare of the dog.




FCI-St. N°308 / 16.03.2012

Only functionally and clinically healthy dogs, with breed
typical conformation should be used for breeding.
