ORIGIN: France.

### DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THE OFFICIAL VALID



### STANDARD: 13/03/2001.



UTILIZATION: Sheepdog.

### FCI-CLASSIFICATION:


Group 1 Sheep and cattle dogs
(excluding mountain dogs
and Swiss cattle-dogs).

Section 1 Sheepdogs.

With working trial.

BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: This variety of Pyrenean
Sheepdog was principally found in the Pyrenean foot-hills where it
was “much appreciated by horse-dealers and cattle-drovers”
according to Bernard SÉNAC-LAGRANGE (1927 club’s yearbook).
Its distinctive features compared with those of other types of
Pyrenean Sheepdogs gained it an appendix in the breed standard
from the 1920s.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: Overall, the smooth-faced Pyrenean
Sheepdog has the same characteristics as the long-coated Pyrenean
Sheepdog.

### IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS:


•
The skull is approximately as wide as long.
•
The muzzle is slightly shorter than the skull, but longer than
that of the long or semi-long coated varieties.
•
The length of the body is almost equal its height.
•
The distance from the elbow to the ground is greater than
half the height at the withers.




St-FCI n°138/15.04.2005

BEHAVIOUR / TEMPERAMENT: Lively, biddable dog,
sometimes wary of strangers.

HEAD:  Furnished with short fine hair (hence the name “smoothfaced”). The muzzle is a little longer than that of the semi-long
coated Pyrenean Sheepdogs.

BODY: A little shorter than that of the long-coated Pyrenean
Sheepdog, it is a more square-shaped body.

LIMBS: Covered in smooth hair with a light fringe of hair on the
front legs and breeches on the hind legs.  The foot is both tighter and
more arched than that of the long-coated sheepdog.
Angulations are more open in this variety.

GAIT / MOVEMENT:  On the move, the smooth-faced Pyrenean
Sheepdog has a shorter stride than the long-coated variety.

COAT: On the body the hair is semi-long or less than semi-long.  It
reaches its longest length on the neck and withers (6-7 cm) and on
the median line of the back (4-5 cm).

### SIZE:


Height at withers: Males
40-54 cm.

### Females


40-52 cm.


FAULTS: Any departure from the foregoing points should be
considered a fault and the seriousness with which the fault should be
regarded should be in exact proportion to its degree and its effect
upon the health and welfare of the dog.

The faults and eliminating faults are the same as those indicated for
the long-coated variety, except for those describing coat and
proportions.
