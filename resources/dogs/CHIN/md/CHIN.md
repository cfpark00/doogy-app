BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: According to ancient
documents it is assumed that the ancestors of the Chin were
presented as a gift from the rulers of Korea (during the Silla Dynasty
age 377–935) to the Japanese court in 732. For a successive 100
years, there appears to have been a large number of Chins coming
into Japan. Historical records also indicate that envoys sent to China
(during the Tung Dynasty age 618–910) and North Korea (during the
Po H’ai Dynasty age 698–926) brought back dogs of this breed
directly. During the reign of the Shogunate Tsunayoshi Tokugawa
(1680–1709) the breed was raised as an indoor toy dog in the Castle
of Edo. In 1613 a British Captain, named Searles brought a Chin to
England and in 1853 Commodore Perry from the U.S. brought
several to the U.S. of which two were presented to Queen Victoria of
England. Since 1868, the Chin has been favored as a lapdog by ladies
of the upper classes, and currently is being widely spread as a
companion dog.
GENERAL APPEARANCE: Small sized dog with broad face,
covered with profuse coat, with elegant and graceful figure.
IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS: The ratio of height at withers to
length of the body is equal. The body of females slightly longer.
