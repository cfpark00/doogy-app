TRANSLATION: Mrs. Peggy Davis.  Latest amendments: Mrs.
Fleur-Marie Missant.  Official language (FR).
ORIGIN: France.

### DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THE OFFICIAL VALID



### STANDARD: 10.08.2023.



UTILIZATION: Pointing dog.

FCI-CLASSIFICATION:  Group 7
Pointing Dogs.
Section 1.1 Continental Pointing
Dogs, type « Braque ».
With working trial.

BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: The Ariège Pointer is most
likely issued from the old French Braques. The crossings made
during the 19th century with Braques of Meridional (Southern) stock
of white and orange coat, gave them more lightness and dynamism.
The headcount had shrunk due to the World Wars, but a few
Ariégeois huntsmen continued to use him, which avoided a complete
disappearance of the breed. In 1990 a team of breeders decided to
devote themselves to its survival and its renewal.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: Braccoïd type. His bone structure is
powerful but without excessive heaviness, robust and of strong
appearance. One prefers subjects with lean legs, prominent muscles,
and well-defined lines. His white coat mottled with fawn in its
different shades or even flecked with brown, together with his size,
give him a distinguished and noble appearance. The skin is
supple but not too loose. The females are usually lighter.

IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS: Medium proportions: the length
of the body is slightly superior to the height at withers. The length
of the skull is almost as long as the muzzle (+ or – 1 cm).



FCI-St. N° 177 / 15.09.2023

BEHAVIOUR /TEMPERAMENT: Stable and sociable with
humans and other dogs. Adapted to all types of hunting, he is
resistant, docile, and easy to train.
HEAD: The head must be long, well sculpted, and rather narrow
at the zygomatic arches. The skin is slightly loose.

### CRANIAL REGION:


Skull: Very slightly rounded, the frontal furrow only lightly
accentuated. The lines of the skull and the muzzle are divergent
towards the front without excess.
The superciliary arches moderately marked. The external occipital
protuberance is quite pronounced.
Stop: Only lightly pronounced.

### FACIAL REGION:


Nose: From orange to more or less pale brown, according to the coat
colour, never black. Nostrils well opened.
Muzzle: Long and straight or slightly convex.
Lips: Quite fine, well let down; the corner of the lips quite folded
without being droopy. The mouth closes finely.
Jaws/Teeth: Dental arches well adapted. Scissor bite. Pincer bite
(incisors meeting edge to edge) is tolerated, as well as the lack of
the two PM1, or one PM2, or one PM3.

EYES: Gentle, frank and expressive look. Eye well open, slightly
oval, well set in the eye socket. The iris is amber coloured or brown
according to the colour of the coat.

EARS: Quite fine, long, curled in, set on at eye level line, carried not
close to the head. Their length permits them, without being stretched,
to reach the beginning of the nose. Flat ears and ears attached high
are eliminatory.

NECK: Medium length, quite strong and with a little dewlap.
