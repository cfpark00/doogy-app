BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: The Jack Russell Terrier
originated in England in the 1800’s due to the efforts of the Reverend
John Russell. He developed a strain of Fox Terriers to suit his needs
for a dog to run with his foxhounds and go to ground to bolt the fox
and other quarry from their dens.  Two varieties evolved with
basically similar Standards except for differences, mainly in height
and proportions. The taller, more squarely built dog is now known as
the Parson Russell Terrier and the shorter, slightly longer
proportioned do, is known as the Jack Russell Terrier.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: A strong, active, lithe working
Terrier of great character with flexible body of medium length.  His
smart movement matches his keen expression.  Tail docking is
optional and the coat may be smooth, rough or broken.

### IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS:


The overall dog is longer than high, i.e. rectangular. The depth of the
body from the withers to the brisket should equal the length of
foreleg from elbows to the ground. The girth behind the elbows
should be about 40 to 43 cms.

BEHAVIOUR / TEMPERAMENT: A lively, alert and active
Terrier with a keen, intelligent expression. Bold and fearless, friendly
but quietly confident.

### HEAD



### CRANIAL REGION:


Skull: The skull should be flat and of moderate width gradually
decreasing in width to the eyes and tapering to a wide muzzle.
Stop: Well defined but not over pronounced.

### FACIAL REGION:


Nose: Black.
Muzzle: The length from the stop to the nose should be slightly
shorter than from the stop to the occiput.
Lips: Tight-fitting and pigmented black.
Jaws/Teeth: Very strong, deep, wide and powerful. Strong teeth
closing to a scissor bite.
Cheeks: The cheek muscles should be well developed.

EYES: Small dark and with keen expression. Must not be prominent
and eyelids should fit closely. The eyelid rims should be pigmented
black. Almond shaped.

EARS: Button or dropped of good texture and great mobility.

NECK: Strong and clean allowing head to be carried with poise.

### BODY:


Back: Level. The length from the withers to the root of tail slightly
greater than the height from the withers to the ground.
Loin: The loins should be short, strong and deeply muscled.
Chest: Chest deep rather than wide, with good clearance from the
ground, enabling the brisket to be located at the height mid-way
between the ground and the withers. Ribs should be well sprung from
the spine, flattening on the sides so that the girth behind the elbows
can be spanned by two hands - about 40 cm to 43 cm. Point of
sternum clearly in front of the point of shoulder.

TAIL: May droop at rest.  When moving should be erect and if
docked the tip should be on the same level as ears.

FAULTS: Any departure from the foregoing points should be
considered a fault and the seriousness with which the fault should be
regarded should be in exact proportion to its degree and its effect
upon the health and welfare of the dog and on its ability to perform
its traditional work.
• Lack of true terrier characteristics.
• Lack of balance, i.e. exaggeration of any points.
• Sluggish or unsound movement.
• Faulty mouth.

### DISQUALIFYING FAULTS:


• Aggressive or overly shy dogs.
• Any dog clearly showing physical or behavioural
abnormalities.

### N.B:


•
Male animals should have two apparently normal testicles fully
descended into the scrotum (this expression is obligatory in every
standard).
•
Only functionally and clinically healthy dogs, with breed typical
conformation should be used for breeding.
