Section 1.3
Small-sized hounds.

With working trial.

BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: The Basset was reputedly
bred by monks in France in the Middle Ages to hunt in heavy cover
and is able to hold its nose close to the ground. Though closely
related to the entire family of French Bassets the breed was
developed to perfection in Britain. He is a dog capable of hunting his
natural prey, the hare, persistently at a relatively slow pace over
prodigious distances.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: Short-legged hound of considerable
substance, well balanced, full of quality. It is important to bear in
mind that this is a working hound and must be fit for purpose
therefore should be strong, active and capable of great
endurance in the field.

BEHAVIOUR AND TEMPERAMENT: Tenacious hound of
ancient lineage which hunts by scent, possesses a pack instinct and a
deep melodious voice. Placid, never aggressive or timid.
Affectionate.

### HEAD


There may be a small amount of wrinkle at brow and beside eyes. In
any event skin of head supple enough as to wrinkle slightly when
drawn forward or when head is lowered.



FCI-St. N° 163 / 27.01.2011
CRANIAL REGION: Top of muzzle nearly parallel with line from
stop to occiput and not much longer than head from stop to occiput.
Skull: Domed, with prominent occipital bone, of medium width at
brow and tapering slightly to muzzle.
Stop: Moderate.

### FACIAL REGION:


Nose: Entirely black except in light-coloured hounds, when it may
be brown or liver. Large and well-opened nostrils, nose may
protrude a little beyond lips.
Muzzle: General appearance of foreface lean, not snipy.
Lips: Flews of upper lip overlap lower substantially.
Jaws / Teeth: Jaws strong, with a perfect, regular and complete
scissor bite, i.e. the upper teeth closely overlapping the lower teeth
and set square to the jaws.

EYES: Lozenge-shaped, neither prominent nor deep-set, dark but
may shade to mid-brown in light-coloured hounds. Expression calm
and serious.  Light or yellow eye highly undesirable.

EARS: Set-on low, just below line of eye. Long; reaching only
slightly beyond end of muzzle of correct length, but not excessively
so. Narrow throughout their length and curling well inwards; very
supple, fine and velvety in texture.

NECK: Muscular, well arched and fairly long with pronounced but
not exaggerated dewlap.

BODY: Long and deep throughout length; withers and quarters of
approximately same height.
Back: Rather broad and level. From withers to onset of quarters
not unduly long.
Loin: May arch slightly.
Chest: Forechest fitting neatly into crook when viewed from front.
Breast bone prominent but chest neither narrow nor unduly deep.
Ribs well rounded and sprung, without flange, extending well back.


FCI-St. N° 163 / 27.01.2011
Underline and belly: There should be adequate clearance between
the lowest part of the chest and the ground to allow the hound to
move freely over all types of terrain.

TAIL: Well set-on, rather long, strong at base, tapering, with
moderate amount of coarse hair underneath. When moving, stern
carried well up and curving gently, sabre-fashion, never curling or
gay.

### LIMBS



### FOREQUARTERS:


General appearance: Upper forearm inclined slightly inwards, but
not to such an extent as to prevent free action or to result in legs
touching each other when standing or in action. Some wrinkles of
skin may appear on lower legs, but this must on no account be
excessive.
Shoulder: Shoulder-blades well laid back; shoulders not heavy.
Elbow: Turning neither in nor out but fitting neatly against side.
Forearm: Forelegs short, powerful and with great bone.
Carpus (Wrist): Knuckling over highly undesirable.
Forefeet: Large well knuckled up and padded. Forefeet may point
straight ahead or be turned slightly outwards but in every case hound
always stands perfectly true, weight being borne equally by toes with
pads together so that feet would leave an imprint of a large hound
and no unpadded areas in contact with ground.

### HINDQUARTERS:


General appearance: Full of muscle and standing out well, giving an
almost spherical effect when viewed from rear.
Some wrinkles of skin may appear between hock and foot, and at
rear of joint a slight pouch of skin may be present, but on no
account should any of these be excessive.
Stifle (Knee): Well bent.
Metatarsus (Rear pastern): Hocks well let down and slightly bent
under but turn neither in nor out and just under body when standing
naturally.


FCI-St. N° 163 / 27.01.2011
Hind feet: Large well knuckled up and padded.  In every case hound
always stands perfectly true, weight being borne equally by toes with
pads together so that feet would leave an imprint of a large hound
and no unpadded areas in contact with ground.

GAIT / MOVEMENT: Most important to ensure that the hound
is fit for purpose. Smooth, powerful and effortless action with
forelegs reaching well forward and hind legs showing powerful
thrust, hound moving true both front and rear. Hocks and stifles
never stiff in movement, nor must any toes be dragged.

SKIN: Supple and elastic without any exaggeration.

### COAT


Hair: Smooth, short and close without being too fine. Whole outline
clean and free from feathering. Long hair, soft coat or feathering
highly undesirable.

Colour: Generally black, white and tan (tri-colour); lemon and white
(bi-colour); but any recognized hound colour acceptable.

### SIZE:


Height at the withers: 33 - 38 cms.

### FAULTS:


Any departure from the foregoing points should be considered a
fault and the seriousness with which the fault should be regarded
should be in exact proportion to its degree and its effect upon the
health and welfare of the dog and on its ability to perform its
traditional work.

### DISQUALIFYING FAULTS


•
Aggressive or overly shy
•
Any dog clearly showing physical or behavioural abnormalities.




FCI-St. N° 163 / 27.01.2011
