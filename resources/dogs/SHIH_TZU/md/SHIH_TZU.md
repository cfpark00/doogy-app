BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: People tend to get confused
between the Apso and the Shih Tzu, but there are a number of very
distinct differences. Roots of this breed are in Tibet but it was
developed in China, where dogs like these lived in the imperial
palaces. China became a republic in 1912 after which examples of
the breed found their way to the West, though the first recorded
importation to Britain was not until 1931. It was recognised as a
breed separate from other Oriental breeds in 1934 and granted a
separate register by the Kennel Club in 1940, with challenge
certificates on offer from 1949. The chrysanthemum look to the Shih
Tzu’s head is most appealing, and this is caused by the hair growing
upwards on the bridge of the nose.

### GENERAL
