BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: The Shiba has been a native
breed to Japan since the primitive ages.  The word « Shiba »
originally refers to something « small », a « small dog ».  The
Shiba’s habitat was in the mountainous area facing the Sea of Japan
and was used as a hunting dog for small animals and birds.  There
were slight differences in the breeds according to the areas where
they were raised.  As dogs like English Setters and English Pointers
were imported from England during the period of 1868-1912,
hunting became a sport in Japan and crossbreeding of the Shiba with
those English dogs became prevalent and a pure Shiba became rare
so that by 1912-1926 pure Shibas confined to these areas became
exceedingly scarce.  Hunters and other educated persons became
concerned with the preservation of the pure Shibas from around 1928
and the preservation of the limited number of pure strains began
seriously, and the breed standard was finally unified in 1934.   In
1937 the Shiba was designated as a « natural monument » after
which the breed was bred and improved to become the breed known
today.
