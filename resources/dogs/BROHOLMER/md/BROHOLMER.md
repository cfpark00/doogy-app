Section 2.1 Molossian, Mastiff type.
Without working trial.

BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: As a type this breed has been
known since the Middle Ages, when it was used for hunting (stag-
hunting). Later it was used mainly as guard dog for large farms and
manors.  At the end of the 18th century these dogs were pure- bred
and increased in number thanks to the Chamberlain Sehested of
Broholm, from whom the breed has inherited its name.  After the
Second World War the breed became almost extinct, but around
1975 a group of committed people - later organized as « The Society
for Reconstruction of the Broholmer Breed » - supported by the
Danish Kennel Club, began the work of reviving the breed.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: A Mastiff-type of dog of large size,
rectangular and strongly built, with a composed and powerful
movement. Its appearance is dominated by the powerful forequarters.
The head is massive and wide, the neck is sturdy with some loose skin,
the chest is broad and deep. The dogs must show a distinct gender
identity. The males must be distinctly masculine and the females
distinctly feminine. At rest the head is carried rather low and
stooping, and the tail is hanging down sabre-like. When moving, the
tail is carried higher, but not over the topline. When the dog is
attentive or aroused, the head is carried higher and the tail is raised
above horizontal.
