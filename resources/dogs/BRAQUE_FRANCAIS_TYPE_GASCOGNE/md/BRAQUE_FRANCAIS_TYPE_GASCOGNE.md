UTILIZATION: Pointing dog.

### FCI-CLASSIFICATION:


Group 7
Pointing Dogs.

Section 1.1 Continental
Pointing



Dogs, type « Braque ».

With working trial.

BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: There are two different types
of French Pointing Dogs: the large size « Gascogne type » and the
small size « Pyrenean type ».  Both types are originally from the
South-West of France and the Central Pyrenees where they stayed in
pure state.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: Pointing dog of medium proportions
with « Braque » type, noble appearance, powerful but without
excessive heaviness, robust with strong bone structure.  The females
are finer. The skin is supple, quite loose.

IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS: Length of muzzle somewhat
shorter than that of the skull.

HEAD: Quite important but not too heavy.  In profile, the lines of
the skull and the muzzle are slightly divergent.

### CRANIAL REGION:


Skull: Almost flat or very slightly rounded; shows a medium furrow
only lightly marked.  The occipital protuberance is barely prominent.
Stop: Neither shallow nor accentuated.




FCI-St. N°133 / 22.09.2023

### FACIAL REGION:


Nose: Broad, brown in colour, nostrils well opened.
Muzzle: Broad and rectangular, sometimes a little convex.
Lips: Pendent; the labial commissure is quite folded.
Jaws/Teeth: Must be complete.  Pincer bite is tolerated.

EYES: Well open and well set into the eye socket, chestnut brown or
dark yellow.  The expression is frank.

EARS: Leathers of medium length, set at eye level, not too broad at
their set on, framing the head well, slightly folded and rounded at
their tip.  One or two vertical folds may be on the cheek at level and
a little above the attachment of the ear.  The tip of the leathers must
reach the rear rim of the nose leather.

NECK: Of good length, slightly arched in its upper part, always with
a slight dewlap.

### BODY:


Back: Broad, straight, sometimes a bit long but always well
sustained.
Loin: Short, muscled, slightly arched.
Croup: Slightly oblique in relation to the topline.
Chest: Broad seen from the front, long in profile, reaching to the
level of the elbow; the ribs are rounded without exaggeration.
Underline and belly: Flat.  Belly only slightly tucked up.

TAIL: Generally docked and continuing the convexity of the line of
the rump, although the long tail, if well carried, is not a fault, no
more than the naturally short tail.

upon the health and welfare of the dog.
• Dog too heavy or too light.
• Occipital protuberance too pronounced.
• Lips too thick or not let down enough.
• Eyes round caused by exaggeration of the zygomatic and
