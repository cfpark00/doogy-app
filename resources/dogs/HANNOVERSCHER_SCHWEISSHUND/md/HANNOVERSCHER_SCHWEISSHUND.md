### BRIEF



### HISTORICAL



### SUMMARY:


The
Hannoverscher
Schweißhund has developed almost unchanged from the so called
«liam hound» (leash hound) of the early Middle Ages. The Liam
hound, from the breed section of the «Bracke», already played an
extraordinary part at the time of the establishment of clan rights of the
Germanic tribes (in about 500AD). With the invention of firearms, the


methods of hunting big game altered. Dogs were needed to search for
wounded game. The  liam hound offered the best conditions for this
and so he became a « Liam-Scenthound ».
This breed description stayed in place until the hunting estate of
the Kingdom of Hannover got more involved with this breed The
Hanoverian hunting estate in the kingdom of Hannover developed
this breed further and preserved the proven methods of handling
these hounds.



FCI-St. N° 213 / 26.05.2015

The Deutsche Schweißhund developed into the Hannoversche
Schweißhund. Since 1894 the registered «Verein Hirschmann e.V.»
has been taking care of the breed, Since then the breeding of these
dogs has continued strictly with regard of their working ability and
the dogs are used exclusively in hunting grounds for big game as
specialists in tracking cloven-hoof game. The dissertation of Dr.
Wolf-Eberhardt Barth of the “Forstlichen Fakultät of the GeorgAugust University in Gőttingen” about the subject “Der
Hannoversche Schweißhund as an example of the development of
the German Gundogs” (Magazines of the Landesjagdverbands
Freie und Hansestadt Hamburg e.V., Landesjägerschaft, Magazine
2, Hamburg 1970, 96 S) is the scientific base for the insight into the
history of this old gundog breed, which is correctly named German
culture asset (Deutscher Schweißhund).

GENERAL APPEARANCE: In general appearance the highly
efficient Hannoverscher Schweißhund is of medium size, well
proportioned and powerful.  Well set strongly muscled fore and hind
limbs qualify him for tireless work. Too long legs, specially overbuilt
forequarters, affect his work with nose to ground and are foreign to his
type. The broad, deep chest provides ample room for the lungs and
enables long, strenuous chases.
The slightly wrinkled forehead and the clear dark eyes produce the
serious expression typical of the Hannoverscher Schweißhund. Also
typical for the breed is the red primary colour of the coat, which can
vary from a pale fawn colour to a dark brindle, almost black appearing
colouring.
