BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: The Bernese Mountain Dog
is a farm dog of ancestral origin which was used as a guard and
draught dog and for driving cattle in the prealpine regions and in the
midland areas around Bern.  Originally, he was named “Dürrbächler”
according to the name of the hamlet and of the inn of Dürrbach, near
Riggisberg in the Canton Bern where these long-haired tricoloured
farm dogs were especially numerous.  In 1902, 1904 and 1907
specimen of this breed had already been exhibited at dog shows, and
in 1907 some breeders of the region of Burgdorf decided to promote
the pure breeding of these dogs by founding the “Schweizerischer
Dürrbach-Klub”, and fixing the characteristic traits of the breed.  In
1910, at a show in Burgdorf where many farmers of that region
brought their Dürrbächler dogs to, already 107 specimens were
shown.

From that day onward this dog, renamed “Bernese Mountain Dog”
following the example of the other breeds of Swiss Mountain Dogs,
became rapidly appreciated all over Switzerland and in the
neighbouring parts of Germany.  Today the Bernese Mountain Dog
is well known and appreciated all over the world as a family dog
thanks to its striking tricoloured coat and its great adaptability.
