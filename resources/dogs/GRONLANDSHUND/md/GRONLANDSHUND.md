BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: The Greenland Dog is one of
the world’s oldest breeds and has since ancient times been the Inuits’
only sledge dog.  Selection of specimens for breeding has been based
mainly upon qualities like sturdy strength, hardiness and endurance,
but an attractive appearance has also been kept in view.  With its
robust nature the Greenland Dog is especially a dog for people
enjoying open-air life. He is an excellent companion for people who
likes strolling in woods or mountains with their dog pulling or
carrying their gear.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: A very strong polar spitz, built for
endurance and strenuous work as a sledge dog under arctic
conditions.  Some variation in size is allowed, assuming working
ability and harmony are not affected.

IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS: The body is short rectangular
with the ratio of height at withers to body length as 10 to 11.
Females are allowed a slightly longer body.

### BEHAVIOUR/TEMPERAMENT:


The predominant temperamental qualities of the Greenland Dog are
energy, mental strength and boldness.  He is a passionate and tireless
sledge dog.  To people - also strangers - he is friendly, and while
acting as sledge dog not closely attached to any particular person and
therefore not suitable as a guard dog.  On hunting seal and polar bear
he will show a strong hunting instinct.

### LIMBS



### FOREQUARTERS:

straight, with powerful muscles and heavy bone.
Shoulder: Moderately laid back.
Upper arm: Straight and strong, somewhat longer than the shoulderblade.
Elbow: Fitting close to the body, but able to move freely.
Forearm: Straight and strong.

moderate angulations.
Thigh: Powerful and very muscular.
Hock joint: Broad and strong, moderately angulated.
Hind feet: Rather big, powerful and rounded, with strong nails and
pads.

GAIT / MOVEMENT: An efficient, harmonious, fluent and tireless

FCI-St. N° 274 / 06.09.2022
shown on a loose lead in a moderate trot to display good reach in
front and good drive from behind.
Seen from front when walking, a Greenland Dog does not single
track, but as the speed increases, the legs will gradually converge
inward until the feet follow the center line.

### COAT


Hair: Double coat, i.e. a soft, dense undercoat and an outer coat of
dense, straight and coarse hair, without curl or wave.  On the head
and the legs the hair is rather short, on the body it is longer and more
pronounced.  The coat is longer on the underside of the tail, giving it
a bushy appearance.

Colour: Any colour - solid or parti-coloured – is permitted, except
albinos and dogs with merle-markings which should be disqualified.

### SIZE AND WEIGHT:


Height at the withers: Males
60 cm and upwards,

### Females


55 cm and upwards.

FAULTS: Any departure from the foregoing points should be
considered a fault and the seriousness with which the fault should be
regarded should be in exact proportion to its degree and its effect
upon the health and welfare of the dog and its ability to perform its
traditional work.
• Light in bone.
• Short legs, body low set.
