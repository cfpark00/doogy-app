BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: Taiwan Dogs are originally
native Taiwanese dogs, descendants of the South Asian hunting dogs
which ancient local inhabitants used to live with in the central
mountainous districts. This breed was the loyal companion of the
ancient hunter in the wild forest. Scholars from the National Taiwan
University, Japan Gifu University and Nagoya University carried out
a cooperative study in 1980 on the subject of the native Taiwan Dog.
They visited twenty-nine tribes of local inhabitants and as a result, it
was confirmed that the present Taiwan Dog is a descendant of the
South Asian hunting dogs. This breed is now popular all across the
island as a watch and companion dog.
