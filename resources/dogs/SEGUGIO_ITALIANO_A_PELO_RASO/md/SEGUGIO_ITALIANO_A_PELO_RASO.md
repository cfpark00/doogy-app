### SEGUGIO ITALIANO A PELO RASO


(Italian Short-Haired Segugio)




FCI-St. N° 337 / 17.12.2015


TRANSLATION: Mrs Peggy Davis.  Revised by Renée SporreWilles. Official language (EN).

ORIGIN: Italy.

### DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THE OFFICIAL VALID



### STANDARD: 13.11.2015.



UTILIZATION: Dog for hunting especially the hare and the wild
boar.

FCI-CLASSIFICATION: Group
Scenthounds and related


breeds.

Section  1.2  Medium-sized Hounds.

With working trial.

BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: The origin of the Segugio
goes back to ancient times. These dogs are certainly descendants of
the primitive hounds of ancient Egypt, used for hunting game. They
were introduced along the Mediterranean coast by Phoenician
merchants and finally arrived in Italy. Numerous drawings executed
under divers dynasties of Egyptian Pharaohs bear witness to the
presence of dogs very much resembling the present Segugio.  Lets
point out in particular the presence of hanging ears, undoubtedly a
sign of an advanced domestication. One may therefore assume that
the ancient dog for the scent-hunting game, landed in Italy and gave
birth to the present Segugio, whose general anatomical particularities
have been maintained practically without change throughout the
centuries. Dogs of the same type and stature as the present Segugio
figure on statues of "Diane the huntress" in the Naples Museum and
that of "Diane with bow and arrow” in the Vatican Museum. In the
castle of Borso d’Este (1600) there is a painting, which represents the
ideal type of the present Segugio.




FCI-St. N° 337 / 17.12.2015

GENERAL APPEARANCE: Dog of medium proportions, the body
of which fits into a square; of robust construction, well balanced,
with well developed bone, lean shape, provided with good muscles
without the least trace of fat; longish head of which the upper
longitudinal cranial-facial axes are divergent; short-haired coat.

### IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS:


The length of the body is equal to the height at the withers (fits into a
square). The depth of the chest is equal to half of the height at  the
withers. The length of the muzzle is equal to half the length of the
head.  The neck must reach in length 4/l0th of the height at the
withers.

BEHAVIOUR/TEMPERAMENT: Scent hound well adapted to the
most varied terrains; endowed with a great resistance and good
speed, is extremely eager, whether working alone or in a pack; of a
steady temperament but not very outgoing, has a soft expression and
a resonant very pleasant voice.

### HEAD



### CRANIAL REGION:


Skull:  Seen from above, the shape of the skull is nearly oval. In
profile, the axes of the skull and the muzzle are divergent; the upper
profile of the skull is slightly convex; the bi-zygomatic width is
inferior to half of the length of the head; the superciliary arches are
barely developed; the frontal furrow is only slightly marked; the
occipital crest is short, neat and prominent without exaggeration.
Stop: Only slightly marked.

### FACIAL REGION:


Nose: Sufficiently large, mobile with well opened nostrils; the
openings are slightly lateral; always black.




FCI-St. N° 337 / 17.12.2015

Muzzle: The length of the muzzle is equal to half the length of the
head; the depth slightly exceed the length; the width of the muzzle,
measured at mid-length, must be slightly inferior to one fifth of the
length of the head; the upper profile of the muzzle is slightly convex
(Roman nose), the lateral faces of the muzzle converge towards the
front; the branches of the lower jaw are almost straight in their entire
length the lower lateral profile of the muzzle is defined by the upper
lip.
Lips: Fine and thin; seen from the front as well as in profile, not
much developed in deepness; in profile the upper lips show a slight
curve at the lower edge. The lip rims are always black.
Jaws/Teeth: The shape of the jaws is like a truncated cone; the
position of the incisors is at a right angle. Teeth complete and white,
regularly aligned and normally developed; scissor bite is correct,
pincer bite is permitted.
Cheeks: Flat and lean.

EYES: Almond shaped, large, luminous, of a dark ochre colour, in
semi-lateral position, with soft expression; the eye rims are always
black.

EARS: Set at the level of the zygomatic arch or slightly lower; the
ears must be hanging and shows a torsion which draws the entire
leather forward, not allowing it to fold over, or to curl. The leather is
of triangular shape, flat in its entire length and very wide; the point
of the leather must end in a narrow point; it is never widely rounded;
tip with a very slight internal volute. The length of the ear must reach
about 70% of the length of the head, and its width, at the broadest
point, measures a little more than half its length.

NECK:  The upper profile is slightly arched, therefore slightly
convex. The length corresponds to or is almost equal to the length of
the head. The neck has the shape of a truncated cone and it appears
very lean and light, giving the impression of not being very muscular
(long muscles).  Fine skin, close fitting, without folds or dewlap;
short hair.


FCI-St. N° 337 / 17.12.2015



### BODY:


Top line: Straight top line which from the withers descends
harmoniously towards the croup with a modest convexity at the level
of the lumbar region.
Withers: Only slightly raised above the top line and narrow due to
the closeness of the shoulder blade points; fusing harmoniously into
the base of the neck.
Back: Profile straight with muscles not very apparent; the length of
the back is in relation of 3 to 1 with the length of the loin.
Loin: The length of the loin measures a bit less than a fifth of the
height at the withers; the width of the loin is close to the length;
muscles of the lumbar region are well developed in length and width.
Croup: Upper profile of the croup is slightly convex; with an
inclination below the horizontal of about 10°; the length measures
about one third of the height at the withers and the width measures
about half the length; muscles are well developed.
Chest: The depth of the chest is about half the height at the withers;
well developed but not barrel-shaped. The chest must reach down to
the elbows. The ribs are not greatly sprung, so slightly convex; the
circumference of the chest being superior to the height at the withers
by a quarter, the brisket is of moderate width.
Underline and belly: The profile is typical in the way of a straight
line in the entire length, from the sternum to the belly; belly is very
lean and not much tucked up.

TAIL: Set on high on the line of the croup. Thin at the base and
uniform throughout the length, except for the tip, which is very fine.
The tip of the tail almost reaches to the point of the hock. Covered
with short hair in its entire length. At rest, the tail just hangs; when
the dog is in action, it is raised above the back line.

### LIMBS



### FOREQUARTERS:


General appearance: Seen in profile, the perpendicular must
correspond to an imaginary vertical line drawn from the scapulohumeral joint down to the ground, which just touches the tip of the
toes, and to another imaginary vertical line, going from the humeroradial joint, which divides the forearm and the carpal joint in two
almost equal parts, and ends at mid-length of the pastern. Seen from
the front, the foreleg must correspond to a vertical line, which goes
down from the point of the shoulder and divides the forearm, the
carpal joint, the pastern and the foot in two more or less equal parts.
The height from the ground to the elbow is equal to half the height at
the withers.
Shoulder: The length of the shoulder blade measures as a third of the
height at the withers; the slope below the horizontal is 45° to 55°; the
muscles are long and lean, apparent and very distinct; the angle of
the scapulo-humeral joint is about 110°.
Upper arm: The length corresponds to about half the height, from the
ground to elbow; more or less parallel to the medial plane of the
body. Arm muscles are long and lean.
Elbow: Placed at level with or slightly below the sternal line and
parallel to the medial plane of the body; the point of the elbow must
be on the descending vertical from the point of the shoulder blade.
The humero-radial angle measures from 135° to 145°.
Forearm: The length measures as about a third of the height at the
withers; perpendicular to the ground and shows a well visible carpocubital groove, which gives the impression of a lean leg, fleshless
and not heavily boned.
Carpus (Wrist):  Lean, extends in the straight line of the forearm.
Metacarpus (Pastern):  The length is at least 1/6 of the length of the
foreleg measured from the ground to the elbow; broader than the
wrist, but flat and lean; seen in profile, the pastern is slightly oblique
from back to front.


FCI-St. N° 337 / 17.12.2015


Forefeet: Oval shaped (hare foot), toes tightly closed and arched;
digital pads not very fleshy; pads lean, hard, tough (leather like) and
black. Nails strong, curved and always black. The presence of some
white (not pink) nails is not a fault.

### HINDQUARTERS:


General appearance: Seen in profile, the perpendicular must
correspond to an imaginary vertical line, which goes from the point
of the buttock to the ground, touching or almost touching the tip of
the toes. The limbs, seen from behind, must correspond to an
imaginary vertical line that, from the point of the buttock, descends
to the ground while dividing in two equal parts the point of the hock
joint, the pastern and the foot. The length of the hindleg is about 93%
of the height at the withers.
Thigh: Long and broad. The length reaches at least a third of the
height at the withers. Muscles are prominent, but clearly separated;
the back edge of the thigh is a little convex. The angle of the coxofemoral joint measures 90° to 95°.
Stifle (Knee):  The stifle must be on a vertical with the hindleg,
therefore should not turn neither out nor in; the angle of the femorotibial joint is of about 115°.
Lower thigh: The length of the lower thigh is slightly less than that
of the thigh; the slant below the horizontal is about 40°. The lower
thigh shows lean muscles even in its upper part, firm and clearly
distinct one from the other; the leg groove is well marked and
apparent; the outer saphenous vein is visible; bone structure rather
light but very solid.
Hock Joint: The width is more or less equivalent to 1/10th of the
height at the withers; the distance from the ground to the point of the
hock joint determines a low hock; the bone structure is solid with the
bony outline clearly visible, which underlines the leanness of the leg;
the femoro-tibial angle is of about 135°.
Metatarsus (Rear pastern):  The length is inferior to half the length of
the foreleg measured from the ground to the elbow; less wide than
the hock, set in a vertical position, i.e. perpendicular to the ground.


FCI-St. N° 337 / 17.12.2015
No dewclaws.

Hind Feet: Oval shaped (hare foot) but less oval than the forefeet,
well knit, arched toes, covered with dense hair; digital pads not very
fleshy; pads dry, hard, leather like and always black. Strong nails,
curved and always black. The presence of some white nails (not
pink) is not a fault.

GAIT/MOVEMENT: When hunting, the dog gallops.

SKIN: Fine and thin, close fitting all over the body. Pigmentation of
the   third eyelids, nails and pads must be absolutely black. A black
pigmentation of the palate is not essential, but highly desirable.

### COAT:


Hair:  Short hair all over the body; straight horse hair texture, dense,
close and uniformly smooth; there may be a few scattered coarse
hairs on the body, on the muzzle, also on the legs which does not
constitute a fault.

Colour:  The permissible colours are solid fawn in all nuances, from
intense red fawn to a faded (washed out) fawn, and the black and tan.
The tan markings, as in all black and tan dogs, should be on the
muzzle, eyebrows, chest, on the legs, from carpus to foot and tarsal
to foot, also on the perineum. Fawn dogs may have white on the
muzzle and the skull, (symmetrical mask or not), a white star on the
chest, white on the neck, the pastern, hocks, on the feet and the tip of
the tail. The white however is not desirable and the less there is of it
the better. The black and tan may show a white star on the chest; in
that case the Segugio is called tricolour.

### SIZE AND WEIGHT:


Height at the withers:  Males:
52 cm – 58 cm.

Females:  48 cm – 56 cm.
Tolerance: ± 2 cm, only for excellent

subjects.
Weight: 18 kg – 28 kg.



FCI-St. N° 337 / 17.12.2015


FAULTS: Any departure from the foregoing points should be
considered a fault and the seriousness with which the fault should be
regarded should be in exact proportion to its degree and its effect
upon the health and welfare of the dog and its ability to perform his
traditional work.
• Continuous pacing.

### DISQUALIFYING FAULTS:


• Aggressive or overly shy dogs.
• Any dog clearly showing physical or behavioural abnormalities.
• Cranio-facial axes convergent.
• Depigmentation total or on major part of the nose.
• Concave muzzle.
• Overshot mouth.
• Wall eye, total depigmentation on the major part of the eyelid.
• Lack of tail or short tail, whether congenital or artificial.
• Slate or lead colour; brindle; coffee, chestnut brown, liver or

when   white predominates.
• Size exceeding the indicated margins of tolerance.

### N.B.:


• Male animals should have two apparently normal testicles fully

descended into the scrotum.
• Only functionally and clinically healthy dogs, with breed typical

conformation should be used for breeding.
