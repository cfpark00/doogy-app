ORIGIN: Belgium.

### DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THE ORIGINAL VALID

UTILIZATION: Scent hound for large game venery, service dog,
tracking dog and family dog. It was and it must always remain a
hound which due to its remarkable sense of smell is foremost a leash
hound, often used not only to follow the trail of wounded game as in
the blood scenting trials but also to seek out missing people in police
operations. Due to its functional construction, the Bloodhound is
endowed with great endurance and also an exceptional nose which
allows it to follow a trail over a long distance and difficult terrain
without problems.

### FCI-CLASSIFICATION:


Group   6 Scent hound and related
breeds.


Section 1 Scent hounds.

1.1  Large sized hounds.
With working trial.

BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: Large scent hound and
excellent leash hound, with very ancient antecedents. For centuries it
has been known and appreciated for its exceptional nose and its great
talent for the hunt. It was bred in the Ardennes by the monks of the
Abbaye de Saint-Hubert. It is presumed to descend from black or
black and tan hounds hunting in packs which were used in the 7th
century by the monk Hubert, who was later made a bishop and who
when canonised became the patron saint of hunters. These big scent
hounds spread throughout the Ardennes, due to the presence of large
game, sheltering in the widespread forests of the region. These Saint-
Hubert hounds were famed for their robustness and their endurance,
especially when hunting wild boar.



FCI-St. N° 84  / 12.07.2002
The first Saint-Hubert hounds were black but later black and tan was
also to be found. In the 11th century these dogs were imported into
England by William the Conqueror. At the same time, dogs of the
same type but with an all-white coat, called Talbots, were also
introduced there.
In England the imported dogs provided the basic root stock. The
progeny of these Bloodhounds received their name as a derivation of
" blooded hound " which means a dog of pure blood, therefore a
pure-bred.
Subsequently the breed was also developed in the United States of
America. In the Southern States especially, these dogs were used for
hunting runaway slaves.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: Large-sized hound and massive leash
hound, the most powerful of all the scent hounds. It is harmonious in
its lines, endowed with strong bone, good muscle and a lot of
substance, but without ever appearing heavy. It is long in structure,
fitting into a rectangle. The overall appearance is imposing and full
of nobility. Its attitude is solemn. The head and neck attract attention
because of their abundant, supple and thin skin, hanging in deep
folds. Its movement is impressive, rather slow and with a certain
rolling gait but lithe, elastic and free. No characteristic should be so
exaggerated as to destroy the harmony of the whole, to give an overdone appearance or even less to harm the health or well-being of the
dog.
Among possible exaggerations should be mentioned eyes which are
too deep set or too small; distended eyelids; too much and too loose
skin with too many and too deep folds; too much dewlap; too narrow
a head. Dogs which are too big, with bodies too heavy or too
massive, are equally undesirable because this impedes their function.

FCI-St. N° 84  / 12.07.2002

### BEHAVIOUR/TEMPERAMENT:


Gentle, placid, kind and sociable with people. Particularly attached to
its owner. Tolerant of kennel companions and other domestic
animals. Somewhat reserved and stubborn. Just as sensitive to
compliments as to corrections. Never aggressive. Its voice is deep
but it rarely barks.

### HEAD:


The most characteristic point of the breed is the imposing and
majestic head, full of nobility. It is deep but narrow in relation to its
length and long in relation to the length of the body.  The bone
structure is clearly visible. The lateral sides are flattened and the
profile is square. The topline of the muzzle is near1y on the same
plane as the upper outline of the skull. On the forehead and cheeks,
the abundant thin skin forms wrinkles and deep folds, falling when
the head is carried low and continuing into the strongly developed
folds of the dewlap. The skin is less abundant in the female.

### CRANIAL REGION:


Skull: Deep, long, rather narrow with flattened sides. The brows are
not prominent although they may appear so. The occipital peak is
very developed and distinctly pronounced.
Stop: Only slightly marked.

### FACIAL REGION:


Nose: Black or brown, always black on black and tan dogs. The nose
is broad, well-developed, with wide open nostrils.
Muzzle: As long as the skull, deep, broad near the nostrils and of
equal width throughout its length. The topline of the muzzle is
muzzle is either straight or slightly convex (slight ram's nose).
Lips: Very long and limp; the upper lips fall over the lower lips and
at the front form a right angle with the upper line of the foreface,
which gives a square profile to the muzzle. Towards the corners of
the mouth they become fleshy flews (less pronounced in the female)
which blend imperceptibly into the abundant dewlap. The edge of the
upper lips comes down about 5 cm below the lower jaw.



FCI-St. N° 84  / 12.07.2002
The edge of the lips is well-pigmented, black or brown, depending
on the nose colour.
Jaws/Teeth: Complete dentition, in correct scissor bite; strong white
teeth, set regularly in well-developed jaws. A pincer bite is tolerated.
Cheeks: Hollowed and lean, especially under the eyes.

EYES: Dark brown or hazel, of a lighter hue (amber) in dogs
without black saddle or mantle. Eyes of moderate size, oval, not
weeping, neither protruding nor sunk into the socket, leaving the iris
totally visible. Lids with no irregularity in their contour, normally
fitting around the eyeball; lower lids a little slack so that a little haw
is visible are nevertheless tolerated. At no time should the eye-lashes
touch or interfere with the eyes. The expression is gentle, kind and
dignified, with a rather melancholy air.

EARS: Thin and supple, covered in short hair, delicate and velvety
to the touch ; very long lobes, reaching at least beyond the end of the
nose when they are laid on the upper line of the foreface; ears set
very low, level with the eyes or even lower, on the side of the head,
falling in graceful folds curling inwards and backwards (curling
ears).

NECK: Long so that the dog can follow the trail with its nose on the
ground; strongly muscled ; the skin of the throat is loose and
extremely developed, presenting a double dewlap, but this is less
pronounced in the female.

BODY: The topline and underline are almost parallel.
Withers: Slightly pronounced.
Back: Straight, broad, long and solid.
Loin: Broad, strong, short, very slightly arched.
Croup: Well-muscled, almost horizontal, never falling away, very
broad and quite long.
Chest: Oval in shape, broad, well let down, clearly forming a keel
between the forelegs; thoracic cage long enough; forechest and point
of shoulder standing out, ribs well-sprung, neither flat nor barrel.


FCI-St. N° 84  / 12.07.2002
Underline and belly: Underline almost horizontal; underside of chest
well let down; flanks well filled, broad and let down ; belly only very
slightly tucked up.

TAIL : Long, strong, thick, set high, in continuation of the dorsal
line ,tapering gradually towards the tip; carried sabre fashion ; on the
move the tail curves gracefully above the line of the back, never
curled or twisting sideways .The underside of the tail is furnished
with harsher hair, about 5 cm long, which becomes progressively
shorter towards the tip.

### LIMBS



### FOREQUARTERS:


General appearance: Well-muscled, powerful forequarters, straight
and perfectly parallel.
Shoulder: Long, well-sloping, well-muscled but not over-loaded.
Upper arm: Long, sloping and forming good angulation with the
shoulder.
Elbow: Well set, neither turning out nor in.
Forearm: Straight, strong round bone.
Wrist:  Firm.
Metacarpus (Pastern): Sturdy, upright seen from the front, slightly
forward sloping seen from the side.
Forefeet: Compact, very solid, neither toeing in nor out; toes wellarched, well knuckled up and tight (cat feet) ; thick solid pads ; short
strong nails.

### HINDQUARTERS:


General appearance: Solid, powerfully muscled, well-balanced with
the forequarters; seen from behind perfectly parallel, neither close
nor open.
Upper thigh: Good length and strongly muscled.
Stifle (Knee): Well-angulated, neither turning in nor out.
Lower thigh: Sufficiently long and strongly muscled.
Hock: Solid, close to the ground and well-angulated.
Metatarsus (Rear Pastern): Strong and short.
Hind feet: Like front foot.


FCI-St. N° 84  / 12.07.2002
GAIT / MOVEMENT: The assessment of the very typical
movement of the Bloodhound is extremely important. At its normal
gait, the trot, the movement is even, with measured steps, springy
and free, covering more ground than any other scent hound and very
characteristic of the breed, rolling but without crabbing. The hind
legs move well at the back, there is good drive from the hindquarters,
the reach of the fore and hindquarter movements is equal and the
topline remains horizontal. The limbs move parallel but at greater
speed the feet single-track. The tail is carried high like a sabre
without the curve becoming too pronounced. The Bloodhound must
be capable of maintaining a trot for a long period of time without
showing signs of tiredness.

SKIN: Supple over all the body, loose and elastic. The thin skin,
very loose and abundant over the head, is very characteristic. On the
forehead and the lateral sides of the foreface, the skin forms folds
which hang down and which are even more noticeable when the head
is carried low .However over-done wrinkles and folds on the
forehead and brows must never harm the eyes. Folds of skin on the
body due to too much skin are not desirable.

### COAT


Hair: On the body, the close-lying hair is short, dense, quite harsh
and weatherproof. On the head and ears the hair is very short and soft
to the touch. The underside of the tail is furnished with hair a little
longer and coarser.

Colour: There are three distinct coat colours: the bicolours black and
tan and liver and tan and the unicolour red.
Among black and tan dogs, the amount of black varies, according to
whether it is a mantle or a saddle.


In a dog with a mantle, black is predominant: the tan (fawn) is only
found on the muzzle, the cheeks, above the eyes, on the forechest, on
the limbs and the anal region. A dog with a saddle has a greater
expanse of tan because the black is more or less limited to the dorsal
region.


FCI-St. N° 84  / 12.07.2002
The same positioning of coloured zones is to be found in the
bicoloured liver and tan. The colours are not always clearly stated
nor distinctly defined. In the darker areas, it is possible to find them
interspersed with lighter or badger hairs. Such a mixture of different
coloured hairs is allowed.
For the unicoloured red, the red can vary from light red to dark red.
A washed-out tan for bicolours or red for unicolours is not sought
after.
A little white on the forechest, on the toes and at the tip of the tail is
tolerated without being sought after.

### SIZE AND WEIGHT:


Height at withers:  The ideal height is 68 cm for males.
62 cm for females.
Tolerance of 4 cm more or less.

Weight:  Males
about 46 - 54 kg.

Females  about 40 – 48 kg.
Height and weight must be balanced.
