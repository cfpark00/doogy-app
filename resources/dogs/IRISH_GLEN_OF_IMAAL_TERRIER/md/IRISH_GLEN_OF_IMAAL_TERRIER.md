### IRISH GLEN OF IMAAL TERRIER




FCI-St. N° 302  / 20.09.2024

ORIGIN: Ireland.

### DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THE OFFICIAL VALID



### STANDARD: 3.09.2024.



UTILIZATION: Like all other terriers, this small, tough breed had
to hunt badgers and foxes, and to keep the rat population to a
minimum.  Now he is a gentle and docile family dog.

FCI-CLASSIFICATION:   Group    3   Terriers.
Section 1 Large and medium sized

Terriers.
Without working trial.

BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: Like many dogs in the Terrier
group, not really appreciated by gentlemen sportsmen before the
middle of the 19th century, the Irish Glen of Imaal is an old breed
which was simply ignored for a long time, rather than the result of
later breed experiments.  He is very much a local dog, confined to
the bleak area of the Glen of Imaal.  The farmers of this area, who
were descended from soldiers given land in the 16th and 17th
centuries as payment for service rendered to the British Crown, had
to utilize their natural cunning and dexterity to survive in this harsh
terrain.  A dog, who could not pull his weight in the day-to-day
struggle for existence would not be tolerated.   So he had to spend
long hours propelling dog wheels and was often pitted against other
dogs in the dubious sport of dog fighting, customs now disappeared.
Before the Irish Glen of Imaal Terrier became known at dog shows,
he had evolved through generations of hard work into the strong
sturdy dog we know today.  The Irish Kennel Club gave official
recognition to the breed in 1934 and a club to promote its interests
was soon formed.

GENERAL APPEARANCE:  Medium sized with medium length
coat, great strength with the impression of maximum substance for
the size of the dog.

than other terriers, though he is always ready to give chase when
called on.
