BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: The Komi dog, also called
the dog of Zyrians, is considered to be the origin of the breed.
However, the basic stock dogs originated from the Lagoda’s Karelia,
Olonets and Russian Karelia, where they were used for all different
types of game hunting. The breeding was started in 1936 with the
goal to create a sturdy dog which barks at big game. Then it was
agreed that the name of the breed is Karelian Bear Dog. The first
standard was established in 1945. The first dogs were registered in


## 1946. Today the breed is common in Finland.



GENERAL APPEARANCE: Medium sized spitz with dense coat.
Robust conformation with strong built.

IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS: The length of the body is only
slightly longer than the height at the withers. The depth of the body
is about the half of the height at the withers. The ratio between
muzzle and skull is approximately 2: 3. The length of the skull is
about the same as its breadth and depth.




FCI-St. N° 48 / 27.05.2015
BEHAVIOUR/TEMPERAMENT: Eager hunter; very independent,
yet works co-operatively to game, marking game by barking. The
senses, especially of smell, are sharp, thus the breed is suitable for
big game hunting. Very good sense of direction. Balanced,
courageous and persistent. Highly developed spirit for game. Very
self-confident, may be territorial towards other males, never
aggressive towards people. Slightly reserved.

HEAD: Viewed from the front triangular in shape, not very long.

Broadest between the ears. The frontal furrow is barely visible. The
superciliary ridges are only slightly developed.
Stop: Not very pronounced, rather long, arched gradually towards the
skull.

### FACIAL REGION:


Nose: Large, black in colour.
Muzzle: Deep, tapering only slightly towards the nose. The nasal
bridge is straight.
Lips: Rather thin and tight.
Jaws/Teeth: The jaws are very strong. The teeth are well developed
and symmetrical; 42 teeth, according to the dentition formula. Close
fitting scissors bite.
