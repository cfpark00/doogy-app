Dogs.

Section  2.1 Molossoid breeds,



Mastiff Type.

Without working trial.

BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: The Bulldog was first
classified as such in the 1630s though there is earlier mention of
similar types referred to as bandogs, a term reserved today for a type
of fighting dog. Used originally for bullbaiting, the Bulldog also
fought its way through the dog pits but after 1835 began to evolve
into the shorter faced, squatter version we now know. It entered the
show ring in 1860 and the ensuing years saw a big personality
change. A delightfully ugly dog with a pugilistic expression, which
belies a loving, affectionate nature to family and friends. One of the
oldest indigenous breeds, known as the national dog of Great
Britain, and associated throughout the world with British
determination and the legendary John Bull.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: Smooth-coated, fairly thick set,
rather low in stature, broad, powerful and compact. Head fairly large
in proportion to size, but no point so much in excess of others as to
destroy the general symmetry, or make the dog appear deformed, or
interfere with its powers of motion. Face relatively short, muzzle
broad, blunt, and inclined slightly upwards, although not
excessively so.




FCI-St. N° 149 / 10.01.2011
Dogs showing respiratory distress highly undesirable. Body fairly
short, well knit, limbs stout, well muscled and in hard condition with
no tendency towards obesity. Hindquarters high and strong.
Bitches not so grand or well-developed as dogs.

BEHAVIOUR AND TEMPERAMENT: Conveys impression of
determination, strength, and activity. Alert, bold, loyal, dependable,
courageous, fierce in appearance, but possessed of affectionate
nature.

HEAD Viewed from side, head appears very high and moderately
short from back to point of nose. Forehead flat with skin on and
about head, slightly loose and finely wrinkled without excess,
neither prominent nor overhanging face. Face from front of cheek
bone to nose, relatively short, skin may be slightly wrinkled.
Distance from inner corner of eye (or from centre of stop between
eyes) to extreme tip of nose should not be less than the distance
from tip of the nose to edge of the underlip.

### CRANIAL REGION:


Skull: Skull relatively large in circumference. Viewed from front
appears high from corner of lower jaw to apex of skull; also broad
and square. From stop, a furrow, extending to middle of skull being
traceable to apex.
Stop: Defined.

### FACIAL REGION:


Viewed from front, the various properties of the face must be
equally balanced on either side of an imaginary line down centre.
Nose: Nose and nostrils large, broad and black, under no
circumstances liver colour, red or brown. Nostrils large wide and
open, with well-defined vertical straight line between.
Muzzle: Muzzle short, broad, turned upwards and deep from corner
of eye to corner of mouth. Over nose wrinkle, if present, whole, or
broken, must never adversely affect or obscure eyes or nose.
Pinched nostrils and heavy over nose wrinkle are unacceptable
and should be heavily penalised.


FCI-St. N° 149 / 10.01.2011
Lips: Flews (chops) thick, broad and deep, covering lower jaws at
sides, but joining underlip in front. Teeth not visible.
Jaws / Teeth: Jaws broad, strong, and square, lower jaw slightly
projecting in front of upper, with moderate turn up. Jaws broad
and square with six small front teeth between canines in an even
row. Canines wide apart. Teeth large and strong not seen when
mouth closed. When viewed from front under jaw directly under
upper jaw and parallel.
Cheeks: Cheeks well rounded and extended sideways beyond eyes.

EYES: Seen from front, situated low down in skull, well away from
ears. Eyes and stop in same straight line, at right angles to furrow.
Wide apart, but outer corners within the outline of cheeks. Round, of
moderate size, neither sunken nor prominent, in colour very dark-
almost black- showing no white when looking directly forward.
Free from obvious eye problems.

EARS: Set high - i.e. front edge of each ear (as viewed from front)
joins outline of skull at top corner of such outline, so as to place
them as wide apart, as high and as far from eyes as possible. Small
and thin. “Rose ear” correct, i.e. folding inwards back, upper or front
inner edge curving outwards and backwards, showing part of inside
of burr.

NECK: Moderate in length, thick, deep and strong. Well-arched at
back, with some loose,
thick and wrinkled skin about throat, forming slight dewlap on each
side.

### BODY:


Topline: Slight fall to back close behind shoulders (lowest part)
whence spine should rise to loins (top higher than top of shoulder),
curving again more suddenly to tail, forming slight arch - a
distinctive characteristic of breed.
Back: Short, strong, broad at shoulders.
Chest: Wide, prominent, and deep. Body well-ribbed up behind.
Brisket, round and deep. Well let down between forelegs. Ribs not
flat-sided, but well-rounded.


FCI-St. N° 149 / 10.01.2011
Underline and belly: Belly tucked up and not pendulous.

TAIL: Set on low, jutting out rather straight and then turning
downwards. Round, smooth and devoid of fringe or coarse hair.
Moderate in length - rather short than long - thick at root, tapering
quickly to a fine point. Downward carriage (not having a decided
upward curve at end) and never carried above back. Lack of tail,
inverted or extremely tight tails are undesirable.

### LIMBS



### FOREQUARTERS:


General appearance: Forelegs short in proportion to hindlegs, but not
so short as to make back appear long or detract from dog’s activity.
Shoulder: Broad, sloping, and deep, very powerful and muscular
giving appearance of being “tacked on” body.
Elbow: Elbows low and standing well away from ribs.
Forearm: Forelegs very stout and strong, well-developed, set wide
apart, thick, muscular, and straight, bones of legs large and straight,
not bandy nor curved.
Metacarpus (Pastern): Short, straight, and strong.
Forefeet: Straight and turning very slightly outward; of medium size
and moderately round. Toes compact and thick, well split up,
making knuckles prominent and high.

### HINDQUARTERS:


General appearance: Legs large and muscular, slightly longer in
proportion than forelegs. Legs long and muscular from loins to hock.
Stifle (Knee): Stifles turned very slightly outwards away from body.
Metatarsus (Rear pastern): Hocks slightly bent, well let down.
Hind feet: Round and compact. Toes compact and thick, well split
up, making knuckles prominent and high.

movement of the utmost importance.



FCI-St. N° 149 / 10.01.2011


### COAT:


Hair: Fine texture, short, close and smooth (hard only from shortness
and closeness, not wiry).

Colour: Whole or smut, (i.e. whole colour with black mask or
muzzle). Only whole colours (which should be brilliant and pure of
their sort).  viz., brindles, reds with their various shades, fawns,
fallows etc., white and pied (i.e. combination of white with any of
the foregoing colours). Dudley, black and black with tan highly
undesirable.

### WEIGHT:


Males:
25 kgs.
Females: 23 kgs.

FAULTS: Any departure from the foregoing points should be
considered a fault and the seriousness with which the fault should be
regarded should be in exact proportion to its degree and its effect
upon the health and welfare of the dog.

### DISQUALIFYING FAULTS:


•
Aggressive or overly shy.
•
Any dog clearly showing physical or behavioural abnormalities.

### N.B.:


•
Male animals should have two apparently normal testicles fully
descended into the scrotum.
•
Only functionally and clinically healthy dogs, with breed
typical conformation should be used for breeding.
