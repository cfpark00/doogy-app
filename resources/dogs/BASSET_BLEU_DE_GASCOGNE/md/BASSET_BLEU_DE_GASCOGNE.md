### BASSET BLEU DE GASCOGNE


(Blue Gascony Basset)




FCI-St. N° 35 / 01.09.2023

TRANSLATION: Mrs. Peggy Davis. Official language (FR).

ORIGIN: France.

### DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THE OFFICIAL VALID



### STANDARD: 01.08.2023.



UTILIZATION: Hound used to hunt with the gun, sometimes
for coursing, as much on his own as in a pack.  His preferred
quarries are the rabbit and the hare.

FCI-CLASSIFICATION:   Group   6    Scenthounds.
Section
1.3
Small
sized
Scenthounds.
With working trial.



BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: The breed was reborn at
the end of the 19th century, under the instigation of some
huntsmen from the West.  Since then its evolution has been
constant as much in the plan of necessary morphological
improvement as in the preservation of the qualities of the dog
from “the South (Midi)”.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: Really typical Basset, denoting
the great breed he comes from; quite substantial but yet not too
heavy.

### IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS:


•
Size/Body length
about 5/8.
•
Depth of chest/size
about 2/3.

BEHAVIOUR / TEMPERAMENT: Very fine nose.  Active,
agile and lively.  Intent in his way of hunting; endowed with a
beautiful howling voice.  Works perfectly in a pack.  Affectionate
and happy dog; need to frisk about.



FCI-St. N° 35 / 01.09.2023

Two black patches are generally placed on either side of the head,
covering the leathers, surrounding the eyes and stopping at the
cheeks.
They do not meet on top of the skull, they leave a white interval
in the middle of which is frequently found a small oval shaped
black spot, typical of the breed.  Two more or less bright tan
markings are placed above the superciliary arches, giving a
“quatreoeuillé” effect to the eyes.  Also, tan traces are found on
the cheeks, the lips, the inner face of the leathers, on the legs and
under the tail.

Height at the withers: Male and females:  34-38 cm.
