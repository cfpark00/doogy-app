BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: Great G.S.: In the middle of
the 19th century the Count Joseph de Carayon-Latour, wanting to
regenerate the declining breed of the  Hound of Saintonge, crossed
the last descendants with the Bleu de Gascogne of Baron Ruble, thus
creating the Gascon Saintongeois but causing the extinction of the
Hound of Saintonge.

Small G.S.: In the middle of the 20th century some hunters from the
South West of France selected the smallest subjects from their litters
of Great Gascon Saintongeois and thus created this variety, intended
originally for hare hunting.

### GENERAL APPEARANCE:


Great G.S.: Very well constructed dog, giving at the same time an
impression of strength and elegance.  Very French in type with
regards to the head, coat, and expression.

Small G.S.: Medium sized dog, well proportioned and distinguished.

### IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS:

Length of muzzle equal to that of the skull.

### BEHAVIOUR/TEMPERAMENT:


Pack hound par excellence, fine-nosed, wide-casting and endowed
with a very sonorous voice. Joins the pack instinctively. Calm,
affectionate and amenable to orders.

General appearance: Powerful forehand.

SKIN: Supple and not too thick. White with black patches.

### COAT


Hair: Short and tight.

Colour: The ground colour is white with black patches and
sometimes speckled but not excessively. Two black patches are
generally placed at either side of the head, covering the ears,
surrounding the eyes and stopping at the cheeks.  The cheeks are tan,
preferably pale.
Two tan markings placed above the superciliary arches give the eyes
a “quatroeillé” (four-eyed) appearance. Traces of tan are also found
on the inner side of the ears and in speckles along the legs.  Some
fawn hairs may appear on the upper part of the ear but without giving
the head a tricolour appearance.  Sometimes at the base of the upper
thigh there is a typical dead-leaf marking called “roe buck mark”.
