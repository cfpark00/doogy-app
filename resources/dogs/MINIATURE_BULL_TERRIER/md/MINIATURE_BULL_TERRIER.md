UTILIZATION: Terrier.

FCI-CLASSIFICATION:  Group  3  Terriers.



Section 3  Bull type Terriers.



BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: It was a certain James Hinks
who first standardised the breed type in the 1850s, selecting the eggshaped head. The breed was first shown in its present form at
Birmingham in 1862. The Bull Terrier Club was formed in 1887.
The truly interesting thing about the breed is that the standard says
quite deliberately: “There are neither weight nor height limits, but
there should be the impression of maximum substance for size of dog
consistent with quality and sex. Dog should at all times be
balanced.”
A smaller example of the Bull Terrier has been known since the early
19th century but fell out of favour prior to the First World War and
was removed from the Kennel Club Breed Register in 1918. In 1938,
a revival was spearheaded by Colonel Richard Glyn and a group of
fellow enthusiasts who formed the Miniature Bull Terrier Club. The
standard is the same as that of the Bull Terrier with the exception of
a height limit.
GENERAL APPEARANCE: Strongly built, muscular, well
balanced and active with a keen, determined and intelligent
expression. A unique feature is a downfaced, egg-shaped head.
Irrespective of size dogs should look masculine and bitches feminine.

BEHAVIOUR/TEMPERAMENT: Courageous, full of spirit, with
a fun loving attitude. Of even temperament and amenable to
discipline. Although obstinate is particularly good with people.

conformation should be used for breeding.
