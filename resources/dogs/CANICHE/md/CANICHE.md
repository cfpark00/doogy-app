Section  2  Poodle.

Without working trial.

BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: Etymologically, the French
word “caniche” (Poodle) comes from “cane”, the French word for a
female duck. In other countries, the name of the breed is associated
with splashing around in water. Originally, this dog was used for
wildfowling. It descends from the Barbet of which it has conserved
many characteristics. In 1743, it was called the “caniche”: the female
of the barbet in French. Thereafter the Barbet and the Caniche
(Poodle) were gradually separated. Breeders worked hard to obtain
original subjects.  The Poodle became very popular as a companion
dog because of its friendly, joyful and loyal character and also
because of its four sizes and different colours which everyone can
choose according to preference.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: Dog of medium proportions, with a
characteristic frizzy coat which is either curly or corded. The
appearance is that of an intelligent dog, constantly alert and active,
harmoniously built, giving an impression of elegance and pride.

### IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS:


The length of the muzzle is approximately 9/10 of that of the skull.



FCI-St. N° 172 / 05.04.2024

The length of the body (scapulo-ischial) is slightly more than the
height at the withers.
The height at the withers is practically equal to the height at the
croup.
The height at the elbow is 5/9 of the height at the withers.

BEHAVIOUR/TEMPERAMENT: A dog renowned for its loyalty,
capable of learning and being trained thus making it a particularly
pleasant companion dog.

HEAD: Distinguished, rectilinear and in proportion to the body. The
head must be well chiselled and neither heavy nor excessively fine.

### CRANIAL REGION:


Skull: Its width is less than half the length of the head. The entire
skull, seen from above, appears oval and seen from the side, slightly
convex. The axes of the skull and muzzle are slightly divergent. The
superciliary arches are moderately pronounced and covered with
long hair. The frontal furrow is wide between the eyes, narrowing
towards the occiput, which is very pronounced. (In Miniatures it can
be slightly less pronounced).
Stop: Only slightly pronounced, but can never be absent.

### FACIAL REGION:


Nose: Developed, vertical profile; open nostrils. Black nose in black,
white and grey subjects; in two-coloured black, two-coloured grey,
black and fawn and in tricoloured subjects; brown nose in brown
subjects, in two-coloured brown and brown and fawn. In fawn
(apricot/red) and in two-coloured fawn subjects, the nose should be
black or brown according to the intensity of the fawn colour. In light
fawn subjects the nose should be as dark as possible.
Muzzle: Upper profile is perfectly straight; its length is
approximately 9/10 of that of the skull. The branches of the lower
jaw are almost parallel.  The muzzle is strong.  The lower profile of
the muzzle is determined by the lower jaw and not by the edge of the
upper lip.



FCI-St. N° 172 / 05.04.2024
Lips: Moderately developed, rather tight, of medium thickness with
the upper lip resting on the lower lip without hanging over it. Black
in black, white and grey subjects; brown in brown subjects. In orange
fawn [apricot] and in red fawn subjects, the lips are more or less dark
brown or black. The corner of the lips must not be pronounced.
Jaws/Teeth: Complete scissor bite. Strong teeth.
Cheeks: Not prominent, shaped on the bones. The sub-orbital regions
are chiselled and very slightly filled. Zygomatic arches very slightly
pronounced.

EYES: Keen expression, placed at the level of the stop and slightly
oblique. Almond shaped. Black or dark brown colour. In brown
subjects, the colour may be dark amber. The eye rims are black in
black, white and grey subjects. Brown in brown subjects. In light
fawn subjects the eye rims should be as dark as possible.

EARS: Rather long, falling along the cheeks, set on in the
prolongation of a line going from the top of the nose and passing
under the outer corner of the eye; flat, widening after the attachment
and rounded at the tip, they are covered with very long, wavy hair.
The leather should reach – or ideally pass – the corner of the lips
when pulled forward.

NECK: Strong, slightly arched after the nape, of medium length and
well proportioned. The head is carried high and proudly. The neck,
without dewlap, is of oval cross section.  Its length is slightly less
than that of the head.

BODY:  Well proportioned. It is slightly longer than the height at the
withers.
Top line: harmonious and taut.
Withers: Moderately developed. The height at the withers is
practically equal to the height from the top of the croup to the
ground.
Back: Short.
Loin: Firm and muscled.
Croup: Rounded but not falling away.



FCI-St. N° 172 / 05.04.2024

Chest:  Reaching the elbow; its width is equal to 2/3 of its depth.
Forechest: The point of the sternum should be slightly prominent
and set rather high. In Standard Poodles, the perimeter of the thorax,
measured behind the shoulders, should measure 10 cm more than the
height at the withers. Oval cross section, broad at the dorsal part.
Underline and belly: Tucked up but not excessively so.

TAIL: Set on quite high at the level of the loin (ideally carried at
“ten past nine” compared to the topline). Tail docking is no longer
authorized.

### LIMBS:



### FOREQUARTERS:


General appearance: Perfectly upright and parallel, well muscled
with good bone. The height from the elbow to the ground is slightly
more than half the height at the withers.

shoulder blade.
Carpus (Wrist): In continuous line with front of the forearm.
Metacarpus (Pastern): Strong and almost upright seen in profile.
Forefeet:  Rather small, firm, of short oval shape. Toes are well
arched and tight fitting.  The pads are hard and thick. The nails are
black in black and grey subjects. They are black or brown in brown

ensemble, the aspect of a Miniature Poodle and the same general
proportions complying with all the points of the standard.
Any sign of dwarfism is excluded; only the external occipital
protuberance may be less pronounced.

### FAULTS:

### Addition to standard



Judging a Poodle in a show does not mean it is judged in a grooming
contest. It is not encouraged to stimulate over-grooming one’s dog.

### AUTHORIZED SHOW CLIPS



The wearing of a moustache is authorized in all clips.

“Lion Clip”: The Poodle, whether curly or corded, shall be clipped
on the hindquarters up to the ribs.
Also clipped: the muzzle, above and underneath from the lower
eyelids; the cheeks; the forelegs and hindlegs, except for the cuffs or
bracelets and optional motifs on the hindquarters; the tail, except for
round or oblong terminal pompom. A moustache is required for all
subjects. Leaving hair, called “trousers”, on the forelegs is admitted.

“Modern Clip”: Leaving hair on all four legs is only admitted on
condition that the following norms are respected:




FCI-St. N° 172 / 05.04.2024
1.Shall be clipped:

a) The lower part of the forelegs, from the nails to the tip of the


dewclaw, the lower part of the hindlegs to the same height.


Machine clipping, limited to the toes only, is admitted.

b) The head and the tail in compliance with rules described
above.
Shall be exceptionally admitted in this clip:
• The presence, under the lower jaw, of short hair no longer than 1cm
the lower line of which should be cut parallel to the lower jaw. A
beard, called “goat’s beard”, is not permitted.
• The suppression of the pompom on the tail.


## 2.   Shortened coat:


Over the body, in order to give “shot silk” effect on the line of the
back, more or less long but at least 1cm. The length shall be
gradually increased over the ribs and above the limbs.


## 3.   Neatened coat:


a)  On the head which keeps a topknot of reasonable height as

well as down behind the neck to the withers and the front,

without discontinuity, to the shaven part of the foot

following a slightly slanting line from the top of the

forechest downwards. On the  top of the ears and for a

maximum of one third of their length, the coat may be cut

with scissors or clipped in the direction of the hair. The

lower part shall be left covered in hair whose length shall

increase gradually, from top to bottom, to end in fringes

which may be levelled.
b)  On the limbs, “trousers” making a distinct transition from the
shaven part of the feet. The length of the hair increases
gradually towards the top to display, on the   shoulder and
likewise the thigh, a length of 4 to 7 cm measured by pulling
the hair to straighten it, in proportion to the size of the
exhibit while avoiding any “fluffy” effect.  The hind
“trousers” must allow for the typical angulation of the Poodle
to be seen.




FCI-St. N° 172 / 05.04.2024

### All other fancy clips which do not comply with these norms


are eliminatory.  Whatever the standard outline obtained by
grooming, it should have no influence whatsoever on the
placements in shows, all exhibits in the same class should be
judged and placed together.

“English Clip”: To the “Lion Clip” add motifs on the hindquarters,
i.e. bracelets and cuffs. On the head: a topknot. For this clip the
moustache is optional. The absence of demarcation on the hair of the
hindquarters is tolerated.  The topknot is optional (it is forbidden to
use lacquer or any other substance to keep the topknot in place).

“Puppy Clip”: Takes over the several shaven parts which
characterize the Modern clip. On the head: a topknot of a reasonable
height. The coat on the forequarters should form a ball, comparable
to an ‘egg’ seen from the forechest up to the topknot. The so-called
‘trousers’ on the forequarters is preserved, accentuating the typical
poodle angulation.
The tail – save for a pompon – should have an oval or oblong shape.
It should be clipped longer than wide with rounded angles.

“Scandinavian clip or Terrier clip”:
The clip is similar to that of the Modern clip, the difference being
that the ears and tail may be shaven.


The latest amendments are in bold characters.
