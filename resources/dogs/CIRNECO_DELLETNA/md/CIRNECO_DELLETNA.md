### DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THE OFFICIAL VALID



### STANDARD: 30.10.2016.



UTILIZATION: Hunting dog – in particular used for wild rabbit.

F.C.I.-CLASSIFICATION:  Group  5  Spitz and  primitive types.

Section 7  Primitive type
Hunting Dogs.
With working trial in Italy.


BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: The Cirneco has been present
in Sicily since ancient times. A Mediterranean dog of ancient origins
that probably descends from hunting dogs that existed in the era of
the pharaohs in Ancient Egypt and was introduced to the
Mediterranean basin by the Phoenicians with Sicily as the elected
region of adoption. Evidence of the presence of the Cirneco on the
island is provided by his portrayal on coins, incisions and mosaics
dating from many centuries before Christ and was always considered
the most ancient, eclectic and highly regarded hunting dog.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: Medium sized primitive type of dog
with an elegant and slender shape, compact and strong built with a
fine coat and upright ears, always alert. The conformation is built on
sub-longish lines.

### IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS:


The length of the body is equal to the height at the withers (square).
The depth of the chest is slightly less than the height from elbow to
ground. Length of head is 4/10th of the height of the withers. The
muzzle never to be shorter than skull. Dolichocephalic skull and with
a cephalic index of less than 50%.



FCI-St. N° 199  / 07.02.2017
Stop with an angle of approximately 150°. The length of the loin is
approximately one fifth of the height at the withers and its width is
nearly the same as its length. The length of the croup is about a third
of the height at the withers and its width is nearly half its length.
Depth of chest slightly less than half the height at the withers (about
43%) and width (measured at the widest part of the chest) is less of a
third (about 27%) of the height at the withers. The thoracic perimeter
exceeds the height of the withers by about 1/8th.

BEHAVIOUR/TEMPERAMENT: The Cirneco is strong-willed,
uncompromising, affectionate and alert, a resolute dog, very attached
to his owner. Fundamentally a hunting dog who uses his keen sense
of smell, but is also an excellent companion. The specific skill is
searching for scent and pursuing wild rabbit and other small game
both fur and feather. The ideal hunting ground is among the nooks
and crannies of rock faces and in particular the terrain formed by
volcanic lava on the slopes of Mount Etna where the Cirneco leaps
from one rock to another, surefooted and elegant. The breed uses
sight only to select the most suitable location and nothing escapes his
attention. The hearing is used to pick up the movement of the rabbit
when it has gone to ground, but it is the powerful, reliable sense of
smell that allows the dog to follow a trail and flush out the prey.

### HEAD



### CRANIAL REGION:


Skull: Longish skull with the width being less than half the total
length of the head. Lengthwise seen from above tends towards an
oval shape; upper longitudinal axes of the skull and the muzzle are
parallel or only slightly divergent. The upper profile of the skull is
only slightly convex, to appear almost flat, the width at the level of
the zygomatic arches is less than half the total length of the head.
Superciliary arches slightly elevated, frontal region slightly elevated
and receding, frontal furrow slightly marked, occipital crest barely
visible and occipital protuberances only slightly pronounced.
Stop: Slightly accentuated.




FCI-St. N° 199  / 07.02.2017


### FACIAL REGION:


Nose: Quite large with a rather rectangular shape. The colour of the
leather ranges from light to dark flesh-colour to brown, depending on
the intensity of the coat colour.  Viewed in profile the nose is in line
with the muzzle and it protrudes over the vertical line of the lips.
Muzzle: The length of the muzzle never to be shorter than the length
of the skull. Measured at the middle of the muzzle, the depth is at
least as half of the length of the muzzle; the width is less than half of
the muzzles length. The muzzle is pointed with the lower profile
defined by the mandible, the bridge of the nose has a straight profile.
Lips: Fine, slim and taut, only just covering the teeth.  The
commissure is barely visible.
Jaws/Teeth: Complete dentition (lack of PM1 and M3 permissible).
and scissor bite. Normally developed jaws, although not strong in
appearance. Mandible only slightly developed with receding chin.
Incisors set square to the jaw perfectly fitting and aligned.
Cheeks: Flat.

EYES: Rather small. Colour should be ochre, amber or hazel, never
grey, brown or yellow. Set at a semi-lateral position and with soft
expression. Oval shaped eye-rims of the same colour as the nose.

EARS: Set very high and close together, carried upright and rigid
with frontal opening. Natural of a triangular shape with a narrow tip
that tilts slightly backwards. Cartilage thick at the base. When alert,
the vertical axes are parallel or almost parallel. The length of the ears
should not exceed half the total length of the head.

NECK: Upper profile well arched; length the same as the head. Neck
set harmoniously into the withers with a smooth outline. Shape of
neck similar to a truncated cone and well muscled especially along
the crest of the neck.

### BODY:


Topline: Straight sloping from the withers to the croup.
Withers: High, narrow due to the convergence of the shoulder blades.
Back: Upper profile straight without conspicuous muscles.


FCI-St. N° 199  / 07.02.2017
Loin: The length of the loin is nearly the same as its width. Short,
slightly developed muscles but firm.  The length of the loin is
approximately one third of the length of the chest.
Croup: Upper profile is rather flat and the inclination approximately
45° below the horizontal, hence steep, lean and strong. The length is
adequate and width is nearly half the length. Inconspicuous
musculature.
Chest: Good depth of chest nearly to the elbow without going
beyond. Ribs slightly sprung, never flat. Rather narrow forechest.
Underline and belly: The contour of the lower profile rises smoothly,
lean without excessive tuck up. Flanks same length as the loin.

TAIL: Low set, fairly thick at base and of equal thickness for most
of its length. Reaching to the hocks or slightly longer. Carried sabre
fashion when at rest and scythe shaped over the back when alert.
Hair semi-long and close.

### LIMBS



### FOREQUARTERS:


General Appearance: Seen in profile an imaginary vertical line from
the point of the shoulder touches the tip of the toes, fore legs keep a
perfect alignment to the vertical axis seen from both sides. The
length of the foreleg from ground to elbow is slightly longer than
half the height at the withers.
Shoulder: Shoulder blade well laid back, length about one third of
the height at the withers, the tips of the shoulder blades are close.
The scapulo-humeral angle is moderate.
Upper arm: Half as long as the length of the foreleg from ground to
elbow. Conspicuous clean musculature.
Elbow: Set in line with the brisket, or below, neither turned in nor
out. Angle between upper-arm and forearm approximately 160°.
Forearm: Perpendicular to the ground. Well marked carpo-cubical
groove; light but solid bone.

### HINDQUARTERS:


General Appearance: Seen in profile show an imaginary line from
the point of buttock touching the tip of the toes. Seen from behind,
an imaginary vertical line from the point of the buttock to the ground
divides the hock joints, rear pastern and hind feet in two equal parts.
The total height of the hind leg is shorter than the height at the
withers (approximately 93%).

Lower thigh: Slightly shorter than the thigh with an inclination to the
horizontal of 45°. Musculature lean and well defined, light bone
structure with marked leg groove.
Hock joint: Length from the point of hock to ground is not longer
that 27% of the height at the withers. Broad at the hock joint and

Metatarsus (Rear pastern): Length equal to one third of the length of
the foreleg from ground to elbow, cylindrical, perpendicular to the
ground. No dewclaws.
Hind feet: Slightly oval shaped, arched with tight toes. Strong curved
nails of brown o pinkish flesh-colour tending towards brown – never
black. Hard pads with pigmentation matching the colour of the nails.
