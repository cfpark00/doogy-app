### SEGUGIO ITALIANO A PELO FORTE


(Italian rough-haired Segugio)




FCI-St. N° 198  / 17.12.2015

TRANSLATION: Mrs Peggy Davis.  Revised by Renée SporreWilles.  Official language (EN).

ORIGIN: Italy.

### DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THE OFFICIAL VALID



### STANDARD: 13.11.2015.



UTILIZATION: Dog for hunting especially the hare and the wild
boar.

FCI-CLASSIFICATION:  Group  6   Scenthounds and related


breeds.

Section 1.2  Medium-sized Hounds.

With working trial.

BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: The origin of the Segugio
loses itself in the passing of time. Dogs of the same type and stature
as the present Segugio adorn the statutes of Diane the Huntress
(Naples Museum) and that of Diana with Bow and Arrow (Vatican
Museum). In a Lombard necropolis of the province of Verona, there
have recently been discovered two skeletons in perfect state of
conservation, of which the conformation is identical to that of the
modern Segugio. At the castle of Borso d’Este (1600), one can see a
painting that gives an excellent representation of the present Segugio.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: Dog of medium proportions, the body
fitting into a square; harmonious as to size (heterometric = normal
proportions between the size and the different parts of the body) and
harmonic in proportion to the profiles (alloidism = concordance
between the profiles of the head and body). The construction is well
balanced, perfectly symmetrical, well built, with lean shapes, well
muscled and without trace of fat, making him capable of following
game from dawn to dusk.




FCI-St. N° 198  / 17.12.2015
IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS: Height from ground to withers is
equal to the length of the body measured from the scapulo-humeral
articulation to the point of the ischium (from point of shoulder to
point of buttock). The withers must not be too prominent, but they
should be slightly above the level of the croup. The length of the
muzzle must reach half the length of the head. The depth of the chest
is slightly less than half the height at the withers.

BEHAVIOUR/TEMPERAMENT: The Segugio is perfectly
adapted to the most difficult terrains and can be used as well in the
mountains as on level ground. Very resistant and fast, he works with
ardour and passion, alone or in a pack. Compared with the
shorthaired subjects, he is more reserved, less exuberant, wise, calm
and poised for the job. His expression is friendly, soft and proud, yet
veiled by a melancholic reflection. His voice is resonant and very
harmonious.

HEAD: Longish in shape. The length reaches 4/10ths of the height at
the withers.

### CRANIAL REGION:


Skull: Seen from above the skull presents un elongated ellipse shape;
in profile, the upper longitudinal axis is moderately divergent in
relation to the longitudinal axis of the muzzle; the profile of the skull
is slightly convex; the bi-zygomatic width must be inferior to half the
length of the head; the superciliary arches are only slightly
developed; frontal furrow not pronounced; the occipital protuberance
should be distinct, but slightly recessed, therefore only slightly
visible, perceptible only by touch; it must be short.
Stop: Only slightly marked; from the muzzle, the upper profile must
ascend in a soft slope towards the skull.

### FACIAL REGION:


Nose: Large; seen in profile protrudes beyond the forward vertical
line of the lips; fresh and moist, with well-opened and mobile
nostrils. Always black.



FCI-St. N° 198  / 17.12.2015
Muzzle: The muzzle measures half the length of the head; the depth
exceeds just slightly half the length; the width reaches 17% of the
length of head; the upper profile is slightly convex; the lateral sides
of the muzzle converge, but not to the point of making the muzzle
pointed. In the entire length, the branches of the lower jaw are almost
in a straight line; they are slightly developed in their fore part. The
sub-orbital region is chiselled, but a little less than in the shorthaired
Segugio.
Jaws/Teeth: Jaws strong in appearance normally developed; the
dental arches of the incisors perfectly adapted. Teeth white, regularly
aligned and of normal size; complete dentition; scissor bite is correct,
pincer bite is acceptable.
Cheeks: Not too marked.

EYES: Large, luminous eyes of dark ochre colour; in semi-lateral
position, the inner corner of the eyelids must be at equal distance
from the forward edge of the nose and the external point of the
occipital crest; fascinating expression, a look soft and proud with a
veil of sadness; eye opening almond-shaped with perfectly close
fitting eyelids. The rim of the eyelids must be black.

EARS: Their inset, of moderate width, is at the level of the
zygomatic arches; they are hanging, of triangular shape, flat in
almost their entire length (66–70 % of the length of the head) and
very broad. The ear ends in a sharp point. Although thin, the ear
cartilage must be rather rigid in its entirety; its insertion, very rigid,
is characterized by a torsion that draws the ear forward without
allowing it to relax nor to fold over on itself, nor to curl. The point is
turned slightly inwards. The ear is covered with hair of moderate
length, shorter than that of the body, less harsh, and without any
fringes.

NECK: The topline of the neck is slightly arched, the lower part
absolutely without dewlap.  The length of the neck corresponds to
the length of the head and thus reaches 4/10 of the height at the
withers.



FCI-St. N° 198  / 17.12.2015
The shape is that of a truncated cone attached to the head by a welldefined nape; the neck must connect to the body by blending
harmoniously with the shoulders; very lean and light, it must give the
impression of not being very muscular.

BODY: The length, measured from the point of the shoulder to the
point of the buttock, is equal to the height at the withers.
Topline: Seen in profile, from the withers to the croup, the topline is
straight.  Just slightly convex at loin level.
Withers: Only slightly raised over the backline and narrow because
of closeness of the top of the shoulder blades; blends harmoniously
with the neck.
Back: Upper profile of back is straight, well muscled even if not very
apparent. The ratio between the thoracic length and that of the
lumbar region is of 3 to 1.
Loin: Short, the width is a little inferior to the length; muscles well
developed.
Croup: Upper profile of the croup is slightly convex. The croup is
considered to be horizontal; the length is about 1/3 of the height at
the withers, quite broad and with powerful musculature.
Chest: The depth is slightly less than half the height at the withers;
well developed without appearing barrel shaped; the arches of the
upper ribs must be well sprung, lower part of chest of moderate
width; the point of fore chest of the sternum must be at the level of
the point of shoulder.
Underline and belly: The lower profile is determined by a straight
line, which rises gradually towards a lean abdomen (belly), never
tucked up. The flanks are slender, never fleshy.

TAIL: Set high, on the line of the croup, thicker at the base than that
of the shorthaired Segugio, it is covered with hair in the entire length,
but without any fringes. At rest, it hangs sabre fashion. In action, it
rises at the level of the topline and wags from left to right, while just
touching the flanks lightly, or sometimes goes round in rotating
movements. The tail is considered to be long although the tip ends
just close to the point of hock.

### LIMBS



### FOREQUARTERS:


General appearance: The forequarters, seen in profile, follow a
vertical line which, from the scapulo-humeral articulation, must
reach the ground while touching the point of the toes, whereas a
lowered vertical from the elbow point must divide in two almost
equal parts, (the large being the front part), the forearm and the
carpus, coming out at mid length on the back of the pastern. The
height of the foreleg from the ground to the elbow is equal to half the
height at the withers.
Shoulder: The shoulder is lean, long, very free in movement; the top
of the shoulder blades are very close to each other. The obliqueness
below the horizontal goes from 45° to 55°.
Upper arm: Well joined to the body; like the shoulder, endowed with
long and lean muscles; set parallel to the median plane of the body.
The scapulo-humeral angle is of 110°, with an obliqueness of the
shoulder blade of 45°.
Elbow: Equidistant from the median plane of the body; neither turn
in nor out. Humero-radial angle of 135° to 145°.
Forearm: The length reaches 1/3 of the height at the withers; the
forearm is vertical, the cubital-carpal groove is well visible. It must
give the impression of a lean (dry) and very thin limb.
Carpus (Wrist): Lean (dry), covered with fine and thin skin. Seen
from the front, it extends in the vertical line of the forearm.
Metacarpus (Pastern): The length is at least 1/6 of the length of the
foreleg measured from the ground to the elbow; in profile somewhat
slanting towards the front.
Forefeet: Oval shaped (hare foot), well knit, arched toes, covered
with dense hair; digital pads not very fleshy; pads dry, hard, leathery,
always black. Strong nails, curved and always black. The presence of
some white nails (not pink) is not a fault.




FCI-St. N° 198  / 17.12.2015

### HINDQUARTERS:


General appearance: An imagined vertical line from the point of the
buttock touches or almost falls on the tips of the toes. Seen from
behind, a vertical line from the point of the buttock divides, in two
equal parts, the point of the hock-joint, the hock and the hind feet.
The total length of the hindlegs is about 90% of the height at the
withers.
Thigh: Long and broad. The length reaches at least a third of the
height at the withers. The lower edge is slightly convex; the point of
the buttock is very visible. The bulging muscles are clearly divided,
one from the other. The angle of the coxo-femoral articulation varies
between 90° and 95°.
Stifle (Knee): In a vertical line with the limb; neither turned in nor
out. The stifle joint angle varies between 110° and 120°.
Lower thigh: The length is just slightly inferior to that of the thigh,
and the obliqueness below the horizontal is 40°. Covered with lean
muscles; the groove between the hock tendon and the bone is well
defined and evident, with the outer saphenous vein quite prominent.
Hock joint: Seen laterally, the sides are very wide; it is considered to
be low because the distance from the ground to the hock point does
not exceed 27% of the height at the withers. The tibio-tarsal angle,
closed because of the accentuated obliqueness of the tibia, oscillates
between 115° and 125°.
Metatarsus (Rear pastern): The length is defined by the height of the
hock-joint; strong and lean, perpendicular to the ground. No
dewclaws.
Hind feet: Oval shaped (hare foot) but less oval than the forefeet,
well knit, arched toes, covered with dense hair; digital pads not very
fleshy; pads dry, hard, leathery and always black. Strong nails,
curved and always black. The presence of some white nails (not
pink) is not a fault.

GAIT/MOVEMENT: Preferred gait is the gallop, but the hunting
action forces him equally to walk and trot.




FCI-St. N° 198  / 17.12.2015
SKIN: Close fitting all over the body, somewhat thick. The
pigmentation of the third eyelids, nails, central and digital pads is
exclusively black. Dark pigmentation of the palate is not required,
but is highly desirable.

### COAT:


Hair: On the body the length of the hair should not be more than 5
cm. The hair is definitely rough, except on the head, on the ears, the
legs, the tail and the muzzle, where the hair is usually less rough than
on the body and the lips; under the lips, the hair, although of
moderate length, forms the so-called beard. The hair on the
superciliary arches is of limited length so as not to fall over the eyes
or hide them.

Colour: The permissible colours are the whole range of solid fawn,
shading from the dark red fawn with black overlay to light fawn, and
black and tan.  The fawn may have white on the muzzle and the
skull (symmetrical mask or not), a white star on the chest, white on
the neck, on the pastern and hocks, on the feet and the tip of the tail.
However white is not desirable, and the less there is, the better. The
black and tan may have only the white star on the chest; in that case,
the Segugio is called tricolour.

### SIZE AND WEIGHT:


Height at the withers:  Males:  52 cm – 60 cm.

Females: 50 cm – 58 cm.
A tolerance of + 2 cm is allowed for excellent dogs.

Weight:
Males: 20 kg – 28 kg.

Females: 18 kg – 26 kg.

FAULTS: Any departure from the foregoing points should be
considered a fault and the seriousness with which the fault should be
regarded should be in exact proportion to its degree and its effect
upon the health and welfare of the dog and its ability to perform its
traditional work.



FCI-St. N° 198  / 17.12.2015
