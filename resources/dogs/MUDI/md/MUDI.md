ORIGIN: Hungary.

### DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THE OFFICIAL VALID



### STANDARD: 25.09.2023.



UTILIZATION: Herding dogs. Because of their courageous
disposition, they are very popular with the shepherds for the use of
herding large and difficult livestock. They are even used for the battue
of wild boar. Excellent guard and companion dogs. Watch and alarm
dogs. Lovable house pets. Because of their relatively short coat and
excellent adaptability, they can be kept in the house too.

FCI-CLASSIFICATION:  Group 1
Sheepdogs and Cattle Dogs
(except Swiss Cattle Dogs)

during the 18th to the 19th century from cross breeding Hungarian
herding dogs most probably with various prick eared German herding
dogs.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: Medium sized herding dog with a
wedge-shaped head. Prick ears. Body topline is distinctly sloping
towards the rear. The head and the limbs are covered by short, smooth
coat. Other parts of the body have a somewhat longer, very wavy to
slightly curly coat. There are different variations of colour.

FCI-St. N° 238/ 27.10.2023


BEHAVIOUR/TEMPERAMENT: The Mudi is extremely able to
learn, of lively temperament, courageous, watchful, keen to work,
alert and adaptable.

HEAD: The most breed typical part of the Mudi is undoubtedly the
head. To the observer it should give the impression of an alert, always
energetic, cheerful and intelligent animal without any trace of timidity
or aggressiveness. The head is wedge shaped, tapering evenly towards
the nose.

### CRANIAL REGION:



Skull: Skull and forehead are slightly domed. Occiput not pronounced.
Superciliary ridges only slightly developed.
Stop: Barely pronounced.

### FACIAL REGION:



Nose: Narrow, rounded at front with moderately wide nostrils. Colour
is black, except for liver (brown), ash liver and its merle varieties
the colour is brown; Ash (blue-grey) and its merle varieties nose
colour is blue; for fawn and white, black nose is favourable but
blue and brown is accepted.

Muzzle: Moderately strong. Bridge of nose straight.
Lips: Tight-fitting to the teeth. Corner of mouth slightly jagged. The
lip pigment corresponds with the pigment of the nose leather.
Jaws/Teeth: Complete scissor bite according to the dentition formula.
Regular teeth of medium size.

EYES: Almond shaped and set slightly oblique. The eyes should be
as dark as possible. For merle colours partially or solid, blue eye
colour is not a fault.  Rims of lids are tight, close-fitting to the eyeball
and evenly pigmented.




FCI-St. N° 238/ 27.10.2023


EARS: High set prick ears which are of a reverse V-shape and covered
with abundant hair reaching beyond the edges of the external ears. The
response of the ears to stimulation is very lively. The dog can turn the
ears independently of each other like a radar screen. Ears are
approximately 10 to 15 % longer than their width at the base.

NECK: The slightly high set neck forms an angle of 50 to 55 degrees
to the horizontal. It is of medium length, barely arched and wellmuscled. Without dewlap or pronounced neck ruff. In male dogs there
can be a barely developed mane; this must, however, never be
noticeable.

### BODY:


Topline: Slightly sloping towards croup.
Withers: Pronounced, long and muscular.
Back: Straight, medium length.
Loin: Short. firmly coupled.
Croup: Short, very slightly sloping, of medium breadth, muscular.
Chest: Forechest slightly curved - reaching the elbows. Ribs
somewhat broad and rather flat.
Underline and belly: Sligthly tucked-up.

TAIL: Set on at medium height. In repose, hanging, with lower third
raised almost to horizontal. When alert and during active movement,
the tail is carried in sickle shape, above the topline. The tail is
abundantly coated; the hair on the underside can even be 10 to 15 cm
long.
Dogs born with or without a natural stump tail are not regarded as a
fault.

### LIMBS



### FOREQUARTERS:

### COAT
