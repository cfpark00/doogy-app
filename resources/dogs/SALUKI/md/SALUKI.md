BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: Salukis vary in type and the
variation is desired and typical for the breed.  The reason for the
variation is the special place held by the Saluki in the Arab tradition
and the immense size of the Middle East area where the Saluki has
been used as a hound of the chase for thousands of years.  Originally
each tribe had Salukis best suited for hunting the particular game in
its own area, but by Middle East tradition, Salukis are not bought or
sold but presented as marks of honour.  It follows that those
presented as such to Europeans and brought to Europe came from a
wide variation of terrain and climate and vary accordingly.  The
British 1923 standard was the first official European breed standard
for the Saluki and was drawn up to cover all these original types of
Saluki.



GENERAL APPEARANCE: The whole appearance of this breed
should give an impression of grace and symmetry and of great speed
and endurance coupled with strength and activity.
Smooth variety: the points should be the same with the exception of
the coat which has no feathering.
