### GALGO ESPAÑOL


(Spanish Greyhound)




FCI-St. N° 285 / 24.05.2002

TRANSLATION: Mrs. Peggy Davis. Official language (ES).

ORIGIN: Spain.

### DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THE OFFICIAL VALID



### STANDARD: 26.05.1982.



UTILIZATION: A dog hunting the hare in fast pursuit in open
fields, being directed by his sight.  Formerly he has also been used
and can hunt other game animals like rabbits, foxes, also boars;
however the primordial utilization of the breed has been and is the
hunt of the hare in open fields.

### FCI-CLASSIFICATION:


Group 10 Sighthounds.

Section 3
Short-haired



Sighthounds.

Without working trial.

BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: The Spanish greyhound is
known since the antiquity by the Romans, even though we are led to
suppose that his arrival and implantation in the Peninsula dates back
long before that period.  Descendant from ancient Asian greyhounds,
he has adapted himself to our different terrain of steppes and plains.
He was exported in large quantities to other countries like Ireland,
England during the XVIth, XVIIth and XVIIIth centuries.  Our
Spanish greyhound is one of the ancestors of the English greyhound
which presents with the Spanish greyhound (galgo) the similarities
true to the breed which have served as a base in its selection and
subsequent acclimatization.  Among the numerous citations by the
classical authors, one should select that of the archpriest of Hita who
says : « Hare which goes is soon caught in a chase by the
greyhound... », thus proving the principal and ancestral function of
the breed.




FCI-St. N° 285 / 24.05.2002
GENERAL APPEARANCE: Greyhound of good size, eumetricsubconvex, sub-long line and dolichocephalic. Compact bone
structure, head long and narrow (dolichocephalic), ample thoracic
capacity, belly very tucked up, very long tail.  Hindquarters vertical
and muscled.  Hair fine and short or semi-long and hard.

IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS: Sub-longuish line structure;
length slightly more than the height.  Proportions and functional
harmony is to be sought after as much in static position as in
movement.

BEHAVIOUR / TEMPERAMENT: Serious temperament and
reserved in occasion, however when out hunting, proves to be an
energetic and lively hunter.

HEAD: In proportion with the rest of the body, long, lean and
fleshless.  The ratio skull-muzzle is 5/6 : length of the skull 5, length
of the muzzle 6.  Cranial-facial lines are divergent.  Seen from
above, the ensemble skull-muzzle must be very long and even
(without bulges); with a long and narrow muzzle.

### CRANIAL REGION:


Skull: Of reduced width and sub-convex profile, longer than wide.
The skull has a median furrow well marked on its first two thirds; the
frontal sinus and the occipital crest are simply indicated.
Stop: In gentle slope, only very slightly accentuated.

### FACIAL REGION:


Nose: Small, moist with black mucous membrane.
Muzzle: Long, of sub-convex profile, with a narrow, slightly arched
nasal bridge towards the nose.
Lips: Very lean.  The upper lip just covers the lower lip.  The lower
lip does not show a marked corner of the lips.  Fine, tight, with dark
mucous membranes.
Jaws / Teeth: Teeth strong, white and sound.  Scissor bite.  Canines
very developed.  All premolars present.
Palate: Of the colour of the mucous membranes with strongly
marked ridges.


FCI-St. N° 285 / 24.05.2002


EYES: Small, oblique, almond shaped; preferably dark, of hazel
colour.  Calm expression, soft and reserved.
Eyelids: Fine skin and dark mucous membrane.  Fitting very closely
on the eye.

EARS: Broad at the base, triangular, fleshy in their first third part
and finer and thinner towards the tip which will be rounded.  Set-on
high.
When the dog is attentive, they are semi-pricked in their first third
with the tips folded, in lateral direction.  At rest, they are in « rose
type »; close to the skull.  When pulled forward they reach very close
to the corner of the lips.

NECK: Long, oval in cross-section, flat, slim, strong and supple.
Narrow in its cranial part, widening slightly towards the trunk.
Upper profile slightly concave.  Lower line almost straight with a
slight central convexity.

### BODY:


View of the ensemble: Rectangular, strong and supple, giving a look
of robustness, agility and endurance.  Thoracic cage amply
developed; belly well drawn up.
Dorsal-lumbar line: With a slight concavity of the back and a
convexity of the loin.  Without abrupt breaks and without oscillation
when moving, giving the impression of great elasticity.
Withers: Slightly marked.
Back: Straight, long and well defined.
Loin: Long, strong; not very broad and with an arched upper line;
with a compact and long musculature, giving an impression of
elasticity and vigour.  The height of the loin in its central part may
exceed the height at the withers.
Croup: Long, powerful and slanting.  Its slope to the horizontal
exceeds 45°.
Chest: Powerful though not very broad; deep, without reaching the
elbow and very long in its extension up to the floating ribs.  Point of
sternum marked.


FCI-St. N° 285 / 24.05.2002
Ribs: Ribs flat with wide intercostal spaces.  The ribs must be really
visible and marked.  The thoracic perimeter is slightly superior to the
height at the withers.
Belly-Flanks: Belly abruptly tucked up behind the sternum;
whippety.  Flanks short, lean and well developed.

TAIL: Strong at its root and low set, lengthens between the legs
remaining in contact with them.  Tapering progressively ending in a
very fine point.  It is supple and very long; reaching well beyond the
hock.  At rest, falls in a sickle with a pronounced hook at the end and
inclined laterally.  Brought back between the legs with a terminal
hook almost touching the ground in front of the hindlegs, it realises
one of the most typical aspects of the breed.

### LIMBS



### FOREQUARTERS:


General appearance: Perfectly vertical limbs, fine, straight and
parallel.  Metacarpus short and fine.  Harefeet.
Shoulders: Lean, short and oblique.  The shoulder blade must be
noticeably shorter than the upper arm.
Upper arm: Long, longer than the shoulder blade, very muscular,
with elbows free although quite close to the body.
Forearm: Very long, straight and parallel; well defined bones with
well marked tendons. Carpal pads very developed.
Metacarpus (Pastern) : Slightly oblique, fine and short.

The hindquarters give the impression of power and agility in the
impulsion.
Upper thigh: Very strong, long, muscled and toned.  The upper thigh
as much as possible nearing the vertical.  Seen from behind, they will
show, at first glance, a very marked musculature.  Broad, flattened
and powerful, its length is of 3/4 that of the lower thigh.
Lower thigh: Very long with well-defined and fine bones.  Muscled
in its upper part; less so in its lower region; with veins and tendons
clearly visible.

which should be well developed.

trot must be extended, low over the ground, elastic and powerful.  No
tendency to crabbing nor ambling.

SKIN: Closely fitting onto the body on all its parts, solid and supple,
pink in colour.  The mucous membranes must be dark.

### COAT


Hair: Dense, very fine, short, smooth; spread all over the body down
to the interdigital spaces.  Slightly longer at the back of the thighs.
The variety of semi-long hard-haired shows a greater hardness and
length of hair which can be variable; although always evenly spread
onto the whole body, it tends to form a beard and moustaches at the
muzzle, eyebrows and top knot on the head.
