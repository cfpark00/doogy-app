BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: The origin of the Dalmatian
dog can be recognized in paintings and in church chronicles from the
16th to the 18th century. Dalmatians can be found on the altar
painting “Madonna with Jesus and Angels” in the church “Gospa od
andjela” in the town Veli Losinj, island Losinj in Croatia dating back
to 1600 – 1630 and also in a fresco in Zaostrog, Dalmatia, Croatia. It
suggests
that
the
Dalmatian
originates
from
the
eastern
Mediterranean region, in particular the historic province Dalmatia.
The first descriptions of the Dalmatian were found in the diocese
Djakovo, in the Croatia, namely in the church chronicles of the
Bishop Petar Bakic from the year 1719 and the church chronicles of
Andreas Keczkemety from the year 1737. The dog was named with
the Latin name “Canis Dalmaticus” and the height of the dog
described with 4-5 “Spithamus”. Thomas Pennant described this
breed in his work “Synopsis of Quadrupeds” in the year 1771 as
very independent, named it “Dalmatian” and wrote the origin of this
breed to be Dalmatia. A work by Thomas Bewick, published in
1790, refers to this breed as “Dalmatian or Coach Dog”. The first
unofficial Dalmatian Standard was written by an Englishman named
Vero Shaw in the year 1882.
After the formation of the Dalmatian Club in England in the year
1890 this standard was transferred to the first official breed standard.

withers = 10 : 9. The height at the elbow joint: 50% of the height at
the withers. The height the hocks: 20-25% of the height at the
withers. Length of head: around 40% of the height at the withers.
Length of skull : length of muzzle = 1 : 1.

Lively kind, loyal, independent and easy to train. The Dalmatian
likes water and outdoor activities. It has a marked hound instinct.

of the body and not too wide in the skull area. The length from the
occipital protuberance to the stop and from the stop to the tip of the
nose equals 1:1, or the muzzle is slightly shorter. The upper line of
the skull and the upper line of the muzzle are slightly divergent. The
masseter muscle and the cheek bone must not be too developed. The
head must be entirely free from wrinkle.

### CRANIAL REGION:


Skull: Flat, with a slight lateral rounding. Broadest between the ears
and well defined temples. Slight frontal furrow.

be in exact proportion to its degree and its effect upon the health and
welfare of the dog and on its ability to perform its traditional work.
