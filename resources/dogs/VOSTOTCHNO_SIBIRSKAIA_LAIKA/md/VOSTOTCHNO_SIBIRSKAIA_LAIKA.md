BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: This native Russian hunting
breed is one of the principle hunting dogs of the Taiga region as well
as mountain areas in Central and East Siberia. The breed evolved from
off-spring of Tungus, Yakut, pre-Baikal and pre-Amur Laikas. The
first description of the pre-Amur Laika, which later become the basis
of the breed standard, dates from the beginning of the 20th century. In


## 1947 East-Siberian Laika achieved breed status. In 1949 the


provisional standard was published and in 1981 the final standard for
was approved.
Nowadays the East-Siberian Laika is widespread in its native/original
areas. Foundation stock from kennels with dogs well established in
type and ability to work has been introduced to the Irkutsk region of
the Russian Federation.
There is a vast population of the breed in the European part of Russia,
especially in the Leningrad, Smolensk, and Tver regions and part of the
Moscow region. The East-Siberian Laika is also appreciated in
Scandinavia.
