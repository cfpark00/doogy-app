### BRIQUET GRIFFON VENDEEN




FCI-St. N° 19 / 18.02.2000
TRANSLATION: John Miller and Raymond Triquet.  Official
language (FR).


ORIGIN: France.

### DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THE OFFICIAL VALID



### STANDARD: 09.01.1999.



UTILIZATION: Scenthound for hunting with the gun of large
game, and also of fox and hare, usually working in a small pack.

### FCI-CLASSIFICATION:


Group 6
Scenthounds and related



breeds.



Section 1.2 Medium-sized Hounds.

With working trial.



BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: It is the only breed having
kept this name « Briquet », which means « medium-sized dog ».
Selection dates from before the first World War by the Comte
d’Elva.  It is a harmonious and improved reduction of the Grand
Griffon Vendéen, distinguished, rather stocky in its construction.
Decimated several times because of wars, the Briquet type
reappeared in Fontenay le Comte (Vendée) in 1946.  At present, one
finds numerous subjects of quality; a team of Briquets won the
trophy of France on roe deer in 1995 and numerous teams are
unleashed on wild boar.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: Griffon of medium size, receptive
and very determined.  Rather stocky and well proportioned.

### BEHAVIOUR / TEMPERAMENT:


Behaviour: Fine nose; fast dog with pleasant voice, does not refuse
bramble; very nimble on rough terrain, hunts rather with nose to the
wind.



FCI-St. N° 19 / 18.02.2000
Temperament: It takes a lot of initiative, has stamina and is robust.  It
must be equally good at working a cold track, at starting game and at
driving it. The Briquet is a passionate hunter; it is up to his master to
make im obey.
