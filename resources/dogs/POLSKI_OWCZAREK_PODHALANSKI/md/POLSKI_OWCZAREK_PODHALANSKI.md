BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: Dogs that herd and guard
sheep and other livestock have lived in the Carpathian
Mountains for centuries. The Polish Tatra Shepherd breed
originated from dogs of this type that were bred by the
shepherding tribes who settled in the Podhale region of the Tatra
range of the Carpathians in the fifteenth century. It is one of the
so-called “mountain dogs” descending from the Tibetan Mastiff,
and its history follows that of similar dogs from the Czech
Republic, Hungary, and Romania.

The Polish Tatra Shepherd is an old, local breed, used primarily
for flock guarding rather than herding.  Its traditional colour
was pure white, as white dogs could easily be distinguished from
predators such as bear or wolf.   According to Hans Räber, the
first mention of these dogs outside of Poland occurred in 1938, in
the German volume “Die bodenstandigen Hutehundeshlage” by
W. Wiland, who named the breed “mountain dog.”





St-FCI n°252/ 17.02.2025
First attempts at planned breeding were undertaken after World
War I by two existing organizations: The Polish Association of
Pedigree Dog Breeders, and The Society of Working Dog
Breeders in Poland. The first standard was drafted in 1937,
following the first show and breed survey in Zakopane, in the
heart of the Tatras, on September 3-5. In May, 1954 the first
post-WW II show and assessment took place, also in Zakopane,
with some 120 dogs entered, the vast majority of which worked
with sheep. A standard was subsequently drawn up, and it was
eventually accepted by FCI on August 29, 1967 as no. 252a.
Small changes were introduced in 1973 and 1985 (252b); the
current version dates from June 8, 1988. The first pedigreed
litter of Polish Tatra Shepherds was born in 1957 in the coastal
town of Łeba, bred by Dr. Danuta Hryniewicz, whose foundation
stock dated back to 1935.
