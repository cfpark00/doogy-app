UTILIZATION: Watch and security dog.

FCI-CLASSIFICATION: Group  2   Pinscher and Schnauzer –
Molossoid breeds - Swiss
Mountain and Cattle Dogs.

Section 2.1 Molossoid breeds, Mastiff



Type.

Without working trial.

BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: The Mastiff, perhaps not in
exactly the form as we know it today, has been with us for many
hundreds of years, and played its part in history since well before the
Battle of Agincourt, in the early fifteenth century. Even then the
Mastiff was known for his courage and guarding instincts. It is
recorded that when the Romans invaded Britain they found a mastiff
type dog already here, and were so impressed that they took some
back to fight in the arenas of Rome. When the Normans came to
Britain the mastiff type was so common that the French word dogue
found its way into the English language.
The breed almost became extinct in Britain after the Second World
War. Stock was then imported, and since that time the numerical
strength and quality of the breed have taken an upsurge. Combining
grandeur with good nature, he is an extremely large dog in both
height and girth, broad and deep in body, full of substance, with
large strong bones.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: Head, in general outline, giving a
square appearance when viewed from any point. Breadth desired and
in ratio to length of whole head and face as 2 : 3.



FCI-St. N° 264  / 02.03.2011
Body broad, deep, long, powerfully built, on legs wide apart and set.
Muscles sharply defined.
Size is desirable, but only if combined with quality and if absolute
soundness is maintained.  Height and substance important if both
points are proportionately combined. Large, powerful, well-knit
frame.

IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS: Length of body taken from point
of shoulder to point of buttock greater than height at withers.

BEHAVIOUR AND TEMPERAMENT: A combination of
grandeur and courage. Calm, affectionate to owners, but capable of
guarding. Usually indifferent with strangers; timidity is
unacceptable.

### HEAD



### CRANIAL REGION:


Skull: Skull broad between ears, forehead flat, but wrinkled when
attention is excited. Brows (superciliary ridges) slightly raised. Arch
across skull of a flattened curve, with depression up centre of
forehead from median line between eyes, to halfway up sagittal
suture.
Stop: Stop between eyes well marked but not too abrupt.

### FACIAL REGION:


Nose: Black. Broad, with widely spreading nostrils when viewed
from front, flat (not pointed or turned up) in profile.
Muzzle: Short, broad under eyes, and keeping nearly parallel in
width to end of nose; truncated, i.e. blunt and cut off squarely, thus
forming a right-angle with upper line of face, of great depth from
point of nose to under-jaw.
Length of muzzle to whole head and face as 1 : 3. Circumference of
muzzle (measured mid-way between eyes and nose) to that of head
(measured before the ears) as 3 : 5. Whilst in repose, any
exaggeration of wrinkle or excess of skin is unacceptable in
mature adults.



FCI-St. N° 264  / 02.03.2011
Lips: Lips diverging at obtuse angles with septum and slightly
pendulous so as to show a square profile.
Jaws / Teeth: Under-jaw broad to end. Canine teeth healthy;
powerful and wide apart. Incisors level (pincer bite, edge to edge)
or lower projecting beyond upper (reversed scissor bite) but
never so much as to become visible when mouth is closed.
Cheeks: Muscles of temples and cheeks (temporal and masseter) well
developed.

EYES: Moderate size, wide apart. Colour hazel brown, darker the
better, showing no haw. Loose eyelids highly undesirable. Free
from obvious eye problems.

EARS: Small, thin to touch, wide apart, set on at highest points of
sides of skull, so as to continue outline across summit and lying flat
and close to cheeks when in repose.

NECK: Slightly arched, moderately long, very muscular, and
measuring in circumference about 2,5 – 5 cms less than skull before
ears.

### BODY:


Topline: Level.
Back: Wide and muscular.
Loin: Wide and muscular; flat and very wide in bitch, slightly arched
in dog.
Chest: Wide, deep and well let down between forelegs. Ribs arched
and well rounded. False ribs deep and well set back to hips.
Underline and belly: Great depth of flanks.

TAIL: Set on high, and reaching to hocks, or a little below them,
wide at its root and tapering to end, hanging straight in repose, but
forming a curve with end pointing upwards, but not over back, when
dog is excited.

considered a fault and the seriousness with which the fault should be
regarded should be in exact proportion to its degree and its effect
upon the health and welfare of the dog.
