BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY:  Japan has a long  history of
dog fighting, beginning in the 14th century.  With such a history in
the background, this breed was produced as a hybrid of Shikoku-ken
and Western breeds.   Named after the  area where they were  bred,
these dogs are  sometimes called "Japanese Mastiffs".  The Western
dogs used  for creating  the breed were Bulldogs  (1872), Mastiffs
(1874), German Pointers (1876) and Great Danes (1924), all of
which were used to  improve the breed by sequential mating.
According to some  accounts, St.Bernards and  Bull Terriers were
also  involved, but it  is  not  known in  what  years  they were  used.
The  Tosa's established features  of stamina  and the fighting instinct
typically found in Mastiffs may be attributed to the involvement of
such breeds.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: Large-sized dog with a stately
manner and robust build.   The dog  has hanging  ears, short  hair, a
square muzzle  and hanging tail thick at the root.

BEHAVIOUR/TEMPERAMENT:  The  temperament   is  marked
by  patience, composure, boldness and courage.
