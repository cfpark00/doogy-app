BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: A cattle dog originating in the
island of Saint Miguel in the Azores, also known as the « Cow
Dog ».  Its history is linked to that of the now extinct Terceira Dog.
The existence of the Saint Miguel Cattle Dog has been documented
since the beginning of the 19th century.



GENERAL APPEARANCE: Robust and hardy.

### IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS:


• Slightly longer than high.

BEHAVIOUR/TEMPERAMENT: A cattle dog par excellence, it is
equally a good guard dog for properties and people. A very
determined character towards strangers but docile with its owner.
Very intelligent and very receptive.  While carrying out its duties
driving dairy herds it bites low to avoid harming the cows’ udders.
However when dealing with stray cattle it may bite higher.
