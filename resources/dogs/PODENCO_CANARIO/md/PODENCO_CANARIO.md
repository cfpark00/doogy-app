### PODENCO CANARIO


(Canarian Warren Hound - Canarian Podenco)




FCI-St. N° 329 / 03.11.1999
TRANSLATION: Mrs. Peggy Davis.  Official language (ES).

ORIGIN: Spain.

### DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THE OFFICIAL VALID



### STANDARD: 24.06.1987.



UTILIZATION: Is used for rabbit hunting, and to that end, adapts
perfectly to the many irregularities of the terrain by using his
prodigious nose, his sight and hearing.  He endures easily high
temperatures and is capable of hunting from dawn to nightfall.
Thanks to his nose and his hearing, he can also detect the presence of
rabbits at the bottom of natural crevices of the terrain, in cracks in
walls, in the heaps of stones at the edges of ploughed fields, in the
volcanic tubes and in the thorny bushes.  His extraordinary survival
is no doubt due to his gifts as a hunter which have made him
irreplaceable during the centuries.  He is mainly a tracker dog who
must neither bark nor catch the game during his scenting work.  Is
also used in hunting, combined with the ferret, method of hunting
authorised on the islands.  He usually takes the rabbits in his mouth.

FCI-CLASSIFICATION:  Group 5

BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: On the Canary Islands, from
where he originates, he is known under the name of Podenco
Canario.  We meet him frequently on all the islands, especially on
the biggest, on the Gran Canary Island and the Isle of Teneriffe.  The
Podenco Canario is a dog of Egyptian origin which was probably
imported to the Canary Islands by the Phoenicians, the Greeks, the
Carthaginians and the Egyptians themselves.




FCI-St. N° 329 / 03.11.1999
It is one of the most ancient breeds in existence, because we find
numerous vestiges (engravings, statues, bas-reliefs) in the tombs of
the Pharaohs and in the museums of the Louvre or the British
Museum.  This breed dates back about seven thousand years.


GENERAL APPEARANCE: It is a dog of medium size, built on
longish lines, slender, light and extremely resistant.  The skeleton is
well developed.  The absence of layers of fat make it possible to see
the rib cage as well as the spinal column and the hip bones.  The
musculature is developed to the highest degree, lean, the contractions
of the muscles are visible through the skin.

IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS: Slightly longer than high.  Chest
well developed without coming down to the elbow.  Muzzle slightly
longer than the skull.

BEHAVIOUR / TEMPERAMENT: Courageous, nervy, agitated,
and of an enthusiastic dynamism.  Imposing but not at all aggressive.
Attached with abnegation to his master, he stoically puts up with the
most rigorous days without the least sign of fatigue.

HEAD: Elongated, truncated cone shape, well in proportion with the
body, of medium length of 21 to 22 cm.  The cranial-facial axes are
parallel.

### CRANIAL REGION:


Skull: Longer than wide, flat, with the occipital crest prominent.
Stop: Barely marked.

### FACIAL REGION:


Nose: Large, flesh-coloured in harmony with the colour of the coat.
Nostrils moderately open.
Muzzle: Large and prominent, in shape of a blunt cone, more or less
dark flesh colour in harmony with the coat.
Lips: Fine and tight, of a colour in harmony with the nose.
Jaws/Teeth: Scissor bite, teeth adapting perfectly, well developed.


FCI-St. N° 329 / 03.11.1999
EYES: Oblique, small, almond-shaped.  More or less dark amber in
colour; the intensity depends on the colour of the coat.  The
expression is intelligent and full of nobleness.

EARS: Quite big, they rise up when the dog is in a state of excitation
and are pricked in a slightly divergent position.  At rest, they tip
backwards.  They are broad at their set on, ending in a point.

NECK: Well muscled, straight, with smooth skin and without
dewlap, flexible and rounded.

### BODY:


Back: Strong, musculature well developed, fit for the racing and the
demands of the hunt.
Loin: A little elongated.
Croup: Bones of the rump quite solid, more visible in the thin
subjects or in full hunting season.
Chest: The sternum is not protruding.  Chest well developed, yet
does not come down to the elbow.  Ribs oval.  The thoracic
perimeter exceeds the height at the withers by 5 to 8 cm.
Underline and belly : Drawn up, without being as whippety as the
Galgo.  Flanks well marked.

TAIL: Rather low set, appears as an extension of the rump.  Round,
reaches only a little lower than the hock.  Hanging, or raised in sickle
shape.  A little tapered at the tip, which is usually white.  Is never
rolled up.  It is not desirable it be carried too high when moving.

### LIMBS



### FOREQUARTERS:


General appearance: Perfectly vertical, straight and parallel; bone
structure fine but solid; feet in shape of cat-feet, generally slightly
turned outwards.  Pads firm, slightly oval.

FCI-St. N° 329 / 03.11.1999


### HINDQUARTERS:


General appearance: Well vertical, straight, robust; musculature well
developed; hock quite high (about 18 cm from the ground); cat-feet
really straight, pads firm and oval shaped.  No dewclaws.
Angulations:  Coxal-femoral angle
: about 110°.

Femoral-tibial angle

### Angle of the hock

GAIT/MOVEMENT: The trot must be agile, extended and very
light.

SKIN: Firm, adheres without folds to the body.

### COAT


Hair: Smooth, short and dense.

Colour: Preferably red and white, the red may be more or less
intense, going from orange to dark red (mahogany).  All
combinations of these colours.

### SIZE:


Height at withers: For males:     from 55 to 64 cm,

for females: from 53 to 60 cm.


Because of the differences of configuration of the terrains where the
dog lives and hunts, these average sizes may vary; so one may accept
deviations of 2 cm above the maximum size and 2 cm below the
minimal size, as long as the subjects in question correspond to the
archetype of the breed.

FAULTS : Any departure from the foregoing points should be
considered a fault and the seriousness with which the fault should be
regarded should be in exact proportion to its degree and its effect
upon the health and welfare of the dog.
