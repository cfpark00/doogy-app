BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: At the first dog show in
Sweden in 1886 some 189 scent hounds were on exhibition. Among
them were a sister and brother, named Tamburini and Ralla 1, owned
by a farmer, Per Schiller. They descended from famous hounds kept
at the Kaflås estate. These hounds were probably descending from
Southern Germany. They were rather small, tan coloured with black
mantle and slight white markings. The Schillerstövare was further
founded on Swiss hounds and a considerable infusion of British
hounds, mainly Harriers. The breed quickly became homogenous
with the continental type dominating. The Schillerstövare was
recognised as a breed by the Swedish KC in 1907.
