UTILIZATION: Originally the Bouvier des Flandres was used as a
herding dog, as a draught dog and as churning dog. The
modernisation of farm equipment has affected these first tasks and
nowadays the Bouvier des Flandres is above all used as a guard dog
for the estate and the farm, as a defence and police dog. Its physical
and behavioural aptitudes, its great qualities of scent, initiative and
intelligence warrant its use as a tracking dog, a messenger dog and a
gamekeeper’s dog.

FCI-CLASSIFICATON:     Group
Sheepdogs and Cattle



dogs (except Swiss



Cattle dogs).
Section  2   Cattle dogs (except



Swiss Cattle dogs).
With working trial.

BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY:  As its name indicates, the
Bouvier des Flandres (Flanders Cattle Dog) is native to Flanders, to
both Belgian and French regions of that name, since they are not
divided by any natural frontiers. The cowmen and drovers of stock in
Flanders needing good dogs to drive their herds, only selected from
the local dogs available those specimens which possessed the
required physical and behavioural qualities. The present day Bouvier
des Flandres has inherited these qualities.




St-FCI n°191/27.09.2002
GENERAL APPEARANCE: Sub-brachymorphic. Short and
compact body, strong and well-muscled limbs. The Bouvier des
Flandres gives the impression of power, but without clumsiness.
The Bouvier des Flandres is to be judged in its natural stance,
without physical contact with the handler.

### IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS:


•
Length of body from point of shoulder to point of buttock
should be approximately equal to height at withers.
•
Proportions of length of skull to length of muzzle are 3 to 2.

BEHAVIOUR / TEMPERAMENT:  The Bouvier des Flandres has
the calm, thoughtful character of a sensible, but fearless dog. Its
lively look indicates intelligence, energy and audacity. It is essential
that the Bouvier des Flandres should retain its aptitude for work. Any
change which could harm this must be penalised.

HEAD: The head has a massive appearance, still more accentuated
by the beard and moustache. It is in proportion to the body and
stature. Its clean cut lines are obvious to the touch.

CRANIAL REGION: Well-developed and flat, slightly less broad
than long. Toplines of skull and muzzle are parallel. Frontal groove
hardly denoted.
Stop: Only slightly pronounced; more apparent than real, due to
upstanding eyebrows.

### FACIAL REGION:


Nose: Nose continues the muzzle in a line which is slightly convex
towards its end. It must be well-developed, rounded at the sides and
always black in colour. Wide-open nostrils.
Muzzle:  Broad, powerful, well-boned, straight in its upper line,
narrowing towards the nose, but never becoming pointed. Its length
should be shorter than the skull by 2 : 3. Circumference measured
just below the eyes should be approximately equal to length of head.
Lips: Well-fitting and strongly pigmented.



St-FCI n°191/27.09.2002
Jaws/Teeth: Jaws must be powerful and of equal length. Teeth are
strong, healthy, white and evenly set. Scissor or pincer bite.
Dentition must be complete.
Cheeks: Flat and clean, zygomatic arches are not very protruding.
EYES: Frank and energetic expression, neither protruding nor
sunken. They should be slightly oval in shape, set horizontally.
Colour should be as dark as possible in relation to coat. Light and
wild-looking eyes should be strongly penalised. Lids black, without
the slightest indication of unpigmented areas. Haw should never be
visible.

EARS: Cropped in triangle, carried upright, set high, very mobile; a
crop proportioned to the head size is recommended.
Un-cropped ears:
Position: Set high, above eye level, flaps falling vertically. The fold
must not stand higher than the top of the skull.
Shape and carriage: Half-long, forming an equilateral triangle,
slightly rounded at tip, lying flat against cheeks, except the slight liftup at top of ear set; neither folded nor curled, in proportion with head
size; covered with very short hair.

NECK: Should spring cleanly from the shoulders and is carried
sufficiently upright. Strong, well muscled, widening gradually
towards the shoulders. Length slightly shorter than length of head.
Nape powerful and slightly arched. No dewlap.

BODY: Powerful, close-coupled and short.
Topline: Upper line of back and loins horizontal, tight and firm.
Withers: Slightly raised.
Back: Short, broad, muscled and well-supported, with no sign of
weakness, yet remaining flexible.
Loins: Short, broad, well muscled; must be flexible, with no sign of
weakness.
Croup: Must follow as closely as possible the horizontal line of the
back and blend imperceptibly into the curve of the buttocks. Broad
but not excessively so in males, more developed in bitches. A croup
which falls away or a goose rump is a serious fault.



St-FCI n°191/27.09.2002
Chest: Broad and well let down as far as level of elbows, but not
cylindrical. The first ribs are slightly arched, the others rounded and
well-sloped to the rear, giving the desired length of chest. Flat ribs to
be severely penalised.
The distance from the point of the breast-bone (manubrium) to the
last rib must be considerable, about 7/10 of the height at the withers.

Underline and belly: The underside of the chest rises very slightly
towards the belly, which is only slightly tucked up. Flanks must be
short, especially in males.

TAIL: Set relatively high, the tail must continue the line of the
backbone.
Some dogs are born tailless and must not be penalised for this.
The tail should be docked in the first week of birth leaving 2 or 3
vertebrae.
In countries where docking is banned, the whole tail is admitted.

### LIMBS



### FOREQUARTERS:


General appearance: Front legs have strong bone and are wellmuscled. Perfectly straight and parallel seen from the front.
Shoulder: Relatively long, muscled, without being heavy, moderately
oblique. Shoulder blade and humerus are approximately of the same
length.
Upper arm: Moderately oblique.
Elbow: Close to body and parallel. Elbows turning in or out, in a
natural stance or on the move, are considered a fault.
Forearm: Whether seen in profile or from the front, they must be
perfectly straight, parallel to each other and perpendicular to the
ground. They must be well-muscled and with good bone.
Wrist (carpus): Exactly in line with forearm. Only the pisiform bone
juts out at the back of the wrist. Strong bone.
Front pasterns (metacarpus): Strong bone, quite short, sloping
forward very slightly.



St-FCI n°191/27.09.2002
Forefeet: Short, round, compact, neither toeing in nor toeing out.
Toes should be tight and arched, with strong and dark nails. Thick
and hard pads.


### HINDQUARTERS:


General appearance: Strong, with pronounced muscle, upright and
perfectly parallel seen from the rear. Must move in the same planes
as the front legs.
Upper thighs: Broad, well-muscled, parallel in direction to the
median plane of the body. Femur must be neither too straight nor too
sloping. Buttocks well let down, trousered and firm.
Stifle (Knee): Set approximately on an imaginary straight line from
the highest point of the hip (iliac crest) perpendicular to the ground.
Lower thighs: Moderately long, well-muscled, neither too straight
nor too sloping.
Hock joint: Rather close to the ground, broad, tight. Seen from
behind they should be straight and perfectly parallel when standing.
On the move they should turn neither in nor out.
Rear pasterns (metatarsus): Strong and lean, rather cylindrical,
perpendicular to the ground when the dog is in a natural standing
position. No dewclaws.
Hind feet: Round, solid, toes tight and arched, with strong black
nails. Thick hard pads.

GAIT/MOVEMENT: The whole of the Bouvier des Flandres must
be harmoniously proportioned to ensure free, true and proud
movement. Walking and trotting are the normal gaits, although one
does also encounter amblers. At a normal trot the Bouvier des
Flandres covers its traces i.e.covers the front pad marks with the rear.

SKIN: Tight fitting; no excessive slackness; the edges of the eyelids
and lips are always very dark.

### COAT:


Hair: The coat is very abundant, the outercoat forming with the dense
undercoat a protective layer perfectly adapted to the sudden climatic



St-FCI n°191/27.09.2002
changes in this breed’s native land. The hair must be coarse to the
touch, dry and matt, neither too long nor too short (about 6 cm.),
slightly tousled but never woolly or curly.
Shorter on the head and very short on the outside of the ears. The
inner part of the ear flap is protected by medium long hair.
The upper lip carries a moustache and the chin a full beard, giving
the forbidding expression so typical of this breed. The eyebrows
consist of raised hairs, accentuating the shape of the superciliary
ridges without ever veiling the eyes. The coat is particularly harsh
and rasping on the upper part of the back. It shortens very slightly on
the limbs but remains harsh. A flat coat should be avoided because it
denotes a lack of undercoat. The undercoat is a padding made up of
fine dense hair which grows beneath the outer coat and together with
the topcoat it forms a waterproof covering.

Colour: The Bouvier des Flandres’ coat is usually grey, brindle or
overlaid with black. A completely uniform black is also accepted,
without being favoured. Light-coloured, so-called washed-out coats
are not acceptable. A white star on the chest is tolerated.

### SIZE AND WEIGHT:


Height at withers:
62-68 cm for males,

59-65 cm for females,
with a tolerance of plus or minus 1 cm.
For both sexes the ideal size is the middle range, i.e. 65 cm for
males, 62 cm for females.


Weight: approximately  35 - 40 kg for males

27 – 35 kg for females.

FAULTS: Any departure from the foregoing points should be
considered a fault and the seriousness with which the fault should be
regarded should be in exact proportion to its degree and its effect
upon the health and welfare of the dog.
