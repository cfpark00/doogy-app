### GOS D’ATURA CATALA


(Catalonian Sheepdog)




St-FCI n°87/13.09.2004
TRANSLATION: Mrs Peggy Davis. Official language (ES).

ORIGIN: Spain, Catalonia.

### DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THE OFFICIEL VALID



### STANDARD: 26.05.1982.



UTILIZATION: It is in the driving of flocks that the true essence
of this breed manifests itself, because not only does he obey the
shepherd, but in numerous cases, he shows his initiative, directing
the flock with marvellous ease, preventing any animal from
separating from the others.  Through his great bravery and courage,
he can also be used for guarding missions.  Because of his size, his
beautiful coat, his intelligence and his great loyalty to his masters, he
can be an excellent companion.

### FCI-CLASSIFICATION:


Group 1 Sheepdogs
and
Cattle
Dogs
(except
Swiss
Cattle Dogs).

Section 1 Sheepdogs.



Without working trial.



BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY:  Originates from the
Catalonian Pyrenees, has propagated in all other pastoral zones of
Catalonia.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: Of well-balanced medium proportion,
medium size, with a beautiful coat.

IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS: Slightly longer than high,
approximately in proportion of 9 to 8.

BEHAVIOUR / TEMPERAMENT: A very sedate dog, active and
intelligent, with a noble expression, with a hardy and pleasant
character, really devoted to the shepherd and flocks entrusted to him,
wary of strangers, which at times make him seem unsociable.


St-FCI n°87/13.09.2004
He is very vigilant, very resistant to heat, cold and all atmospherics.
A very frugal alimentation is sufficient for him to work in extreme
conditions.

HEAD: Strong head, slightly convexe and wide at the base, without
heaviness, well proportioned with the rest of the body.  The skullmuzzle proportion is of 4 to 3.

### CRANIAL REGION:


Skull: Slightly longer than wide, with a clearly marked furrow in its
first third part, which gets flatter and remains so up to the occiput
where a crest is formed.  Occipital bone pronounced.
The upper profile of the skull is slightly domed and may show a less
accentuated short space in the middle.  The frontal sinus well
developed, as much lengthwise as widthwise.  Superciliary ridges
well marked.
Stop: Well visible but not too pronounced.

### FACIAL REGION:


Nose:  Straight, proportioned with the head, must be black.
Muzzle: Straight, rather short, in shape of a truncated pyramid, with
rounded outlines.
Lips: Rather strong, short, formed almost straight, with lower lip not
pendulous, strongly pigmented with black; the palate is also black.
Jaws/Teeth: Strong, of good size, white and sound.  Scissor bite.
Blunt canines (tusks) are admitted in the working dogs.

EYES: Wide open, expressive, alert and intelligent gaze, round, dark
amber colour, with black rimmed eyelids.

EARS: Set high, triangular, fine, pointed.  Insertion cartilage supple
and not thick.  Hanging ears, carried close to the head.  Ratio
between ear width: length = 8 to 10.  Covered with long hair ending
in mobile fringes.  For the working dogs cropped ears are accepted.

NECK:  Vigorous, solid, muscled, rather short, but with such
proportions permitting a good mobility, well tied to the shoulders.



St-FCI n°87/13.09.2004

BODY: Slightly elongated, strong, muscled, giving an impression of
power and agility.
Withers:  Well visible.
Back: Topline straight, not saddle-backed, slightly raised croup,
which, in any case, shall be equal or slightly inferior to the withers.
That difference at first sight may seem favourable to the croup
because of the quantity of coat and undercoat which it carries.
Croup: Robust, muscled, slightly sloping.
Chest: Wide, well developed, reaching elbow level.  Curved ribs, not
flat, allowing for a good thoracic capacity in respect of the work.
Underline and belly: Belly slightly tucked up, with short but strong
and well marked flanks.

TAIL: Rather low set, may be long, going beyond the hock, or short,
measuring less than 10 cm.  There are also tailless subjects, and, for
the working dogs, docked tail is admitted.  When the dog is at rest,
the tail just hangs.  It forms a hook in its lower part.  Sabre tail also
accepted.  In action, the tail is raised gaily but not rolled on the back.
Is abundantly covered with slightly wavy hair.

### LIMBS



### FOREQUARTERS:


General appearance: Strong, lean, straight, vertical and parallel, seen
from the front or in profile.  The elbow-wither distance is about
equal to that of the elbow to ground.
Shoulder:  Muscled, strong, slightly oblique.
Scapular-humeral angle: Of about 110°.
Arm: Strong, muscled with parallel elbows, neither in or out, close to
the body.
Humeral-radial angle: Of about 135°.
Forearm: Vertical, strong, fit for the work.
Carpus (Wrist): Following the same vertical as the forearm, rather
short.
Metacarpus (Pastern): Following the same vertical as the forearm,
rather short.


St-FCI n°87/13.09.2004
Forefeet: Oval, pads black and hard, interdigital membranes neat and
well covered with hair, nails black and strong.

### HINDQUARTERS:


General appearance: Strong, muscled, vertical, giving impression of
power and agility.
Thighs: Long, broad and muscled, with strong bones.
Coxal-femoral angle: Of about 115°.
Femoral-tibial angle: Of about 120°.
Legs: Strong bones and muscles.
Hock joint: Must be well let down, parallel and vertical.
Angle of hock: About 140°.
Metatarsus (Rear pastern: Rather short, strong and vertical.
Hind feet: Identical to front feet, but with low set double bony
dewclaws.  These dewclaws are joined together and joined to the first
toe of the foot by a membrane.

GAIT / MOVEMENT: Supple, typical of shepherd dogs. Gallop
only obtained in very large spaces, but in the ring, the typical gait is a
short trot, with that gait peculiar to all dogs with dewclaws.

SKIN: Rather thick, close and tight all over the body and the head.
Well pigmented.

### COAT:


Hair: Long, flat, or very slightly wavy, rough with abundant
undercoat on the whole of the posterior third of the body.  On the
head we notice a beard, moustaches, tuft and eyebrows which do not
affect the sight.  Tail well covered with hair as are all the extremities.
It is noticeable that during the moult we observe a typical
phenomenon: the moult occurs in two times.  First of all it affects the
coat on the front part, giving the impression of two halves of dogs
with different coats; then it is the turn of the hind part of the dog and
everything becomes uniform again.

Colour:  Seen from the distance the dog seems to be unicolour and
may have lighter shadings at the extremities.  Seen close up, it is
noticeable that the colour comes from the mixture of hairs of


St-FCI n°87/13.09.2004
different tone: fawn, brown more or less reddish, grey, black and
white.  The basic colours deriving from this mixture are :
•
Fawn, in its light tones, medium or dark.
•
Sable, with chestnut hairs, fawn, white and black, also in its
light tones, medium and dark.
•
Grey, made up of white, grey and black with shadings going
from silver grey to blackgrey.  If black is dominant and is
simply combined with white, it gives a black which looks
frosty.

There are also dogs with a mixture of black, fawn and reddish
brown, which can dominate in one or several parts, giving the
impression of black and tan subjects.

Not admitted are white or black spots.  Sometimes a few white
hairs, as a star shape on the chest are tolerated, or on the upper
part of the toes, but, in that case however, this must not be
accompanied by white nails.

### SIZE:


Height at withers: From 47 to 55 cm for dogs.

From 45 to 53 cm for bitches.

FAULTS: Any departure from the foregoing points should be
considered a fault and the seriousness with which the fault should be
regarded should be in exact proportion to its degree and its effect
upon the health and welfare of the dog.

### SERIOUS FAULTS:


•
Head flat or without furrow.
•
Rose shaped ears or badly set.  Insertion cartilage thick, long
or sticking out.
•
Light eyes.
•


## 2 PM missing.


•
Slight prognathism.
•
Saddle back.
•
Legs or feet turned in or out.


St-FCI n°87/13.09.2004
•
A few white nails.
•
Lack of bone in the dewclaws or single dewclaw.

### DISQUALIFYNG FAULTS:


•
Aggressive or overly shy.
•
Any
dog
clearly showing
physical
or
behavioural
abnormalities.
•
Lack of pigmentation of the lips, the nose, eyelids and
palate.
•
Brown nose.
•
Blue eyes.
•
White spots.
•
Missing more than 2 PM or any two teeth.
•
Tail rolled on the loins.
•
Lack of dewclaws or interdigital membranes.
•
All the nails white.
•
More than 3 cm more or less of the limits of the size.
•
Head like a Pyrenean shepherd or a Briard.
•
Lower or upper prognathism.

Quality being equal, we tend to prefer dogs without any mutilations
(ears, tail or blunt teeth for reason of work).  We shall refuse those
with such mutilations if they are not dogs working with flocks.  The
well pigmented tones are desirable in the colour and therefore better
appreciated.


NB:
•
Male animals must have two apparently normal testicles
fully descended into the scrotum.
•
Only functionally and clinically healthy dogs, with breed
typical conformation, should be used for breeding.
