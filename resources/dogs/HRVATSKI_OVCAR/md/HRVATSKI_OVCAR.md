TRANSLATION: Christina Bailey / Official language (DE).
Revised by Renée Sporre-Willes.

ORIGIN: Croatia.

### DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THE OFFICIAL VALID



### STANDARD: 03.11.2014.



UTILIZATION: The Croatian Shepherd Dog is a breed with
combined habits, which means it can be used for herding of livestock
as well as a guard dog or companion dog. One hundred years of
breeding the Croatian Shepherd Dog in the valley of east Slavonic,
near house and yard, have formed a dog well adjusted to all
conditions.

FCI-CLASSIFICATION: Group


## 1  Sheepdogs and Cattle Dogs



(except Swiss Cattle Dogs).

Section  1   Sheepdogs


Without working trial.

### BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY:


This breed was most probably developed over several centuries out
of the descendants of the so-called “Pfahlbauhund” (Canis
Familiaris Palustris) in the area of eastern Slavonic, which is a part
of the Republic of Croatia. According to the hypothesis in the
manuscript of Bishop Petar Bakic in the year 1719, which again
refers to an earlier manuscript of the Bishop Petar of the year 1374,
immigrants brought this breed into the homeland. Prof. Stjepan
Romic started the systematic breeding of the Croatian Shepherd Dog
in the year 1935. The breed was first publicly presented at the first
state dog show on 29th and 30th of October 1949 in Zagreb. Dr. Otto
Rohr wrote the first breed standard in the year 1951. The standard
was published by the FCI on 31st of January 1969.




FCI-St. N° 277  / 27.05.2015

GENERAL APPEARANCE: The Croatian Shepherd Dog is a
medium sized dog with a spitz-type, rustic appearance and a head
with a fox-like expression with a characteristic coat and colour.

He gives the impression of a proud, agile, strong, compact but on no
accounts coarse dog.

### IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS:


Rectangular body; length to exceed height at the withers. Females
can be slightly longer than males.
Height to the elbow is 50% of the height at the withers.
The length of skull to slightly exceed the length of muzzle.

BEHAVIOUR/TEMPERAMENT: The Croatian Shepherd Dog has
a lively temperament and balanced disposition; it is fond of and
devoted to his owner. He must neither be aggressive nor nervous and
has to be interested in everything that happens in his surroundings.
This breed has an inherited sense for the work with domestic
animals. The characteristics of this breed are astuteness, courage,
liveliness, endurance, patience and level-headedness during work.
The breed is easy to train.

### HEAD


The head shape like a blunt wedge. The skull and muzzle lines are
parallel.

### CRANIAL REGION:


Skull: Seen from all sides it is harmoniously rounded. The width of
the skull is not more than half of the whole length of the head. The
oval shape of the skull is characteristic. The frontal furrow is not
very pronounced. The superciliary arches are not pronounced.
Occipital protuberance slightly pronounced.
Stop: Moderately developed in depth and length.




FCI-St. N° 277  / 27.05.2015


### FACIAL REGION:


Nose: Must not be set higher or lower than the nose bridge. The tip
of the nose is rounded. The nostrils have to be well open but not too
pronounced. The nose and the inside of the nostrils have to be
completely black pigmented.
Muzzle: Tapers towards the nose in the shape of a wedge. The nose
bridge is straight and parallel with the line of the skull. The lower
jaw has to be strong and harmoniously developed.
Lips: Of medium thickness, tight fitting to the jaw; the visible parts
are pigmented black. The labial commissure is not visible.
Jaws/Teeth: The jaws are strong well developed and the teeth are
white and placed evenly in the jaw. Scissor bite but a pincer bite is
tolerated. The incisors are placed vertically into the jaws. A complete
bite is desirable (42 teeth in accordance with the dental formula). The
missing of premolars PM1 and molars M3 is not taken into account.
The missing of other teeth is undesirable.
Cheeks: Not very pronounced but lean, rounded and well muscled.

EYES: Of medium size, oval shaped, set in an angle of 30–40
degrees. The eyeball is neither bulging nor placed deeply. The eye
colour varies from black to dark chestnut brown. The eyelids must
not be loose and not show any signs of Entropion or Ectropion. The
eyelids have to be completely black-pigmented. The expression has
to be intelligent, lively and inquisitive.

EARS: Of an even triangular shape with slightly rounded tips. They
are set on a line, which follows from the tip of the nose and the inner
eye corner. The size of the ears must be well proportioned to the size
of the head. The ears can be carried either pricked or semi-pricked.
The semi-pricked ear should be erect to 3/5th of the length and the
tip, the upper 2/5th should be folded down. A-symmetrically carried
ears is a fault; the same applies to inadequate firm ears which bend
more or less during action.

NECK: Of medium length, muscular, tapers towards the head, well
connected with the body. Its upper and lower lines are straight. It is
carried in an angle of 45 degrees to the horizontal line and has to be
without wrinkles.


FCI-St. N° 277  / 27.05.2015
The neck appears to be stronger due to the profuse mane, which is
especially distinctive in males.

BODY: Strong, harmoniously developed still elegant. The body
outline is of rectangular shape, which means that body length slightly
exceeds the height at the withers, in males by 8-10% and in females
by 8-12%.
Withers: Slightly prominent with a gradual transition to the neck.
Back: Straight, horizontal, well muscled. When moving the back
should be firm.
Loin: Short, well muscled, well connected to the back and the croup,
the transition to the top line is hardly visible. In females the loin is
slightly longer than in males.
Croup: Well muscled, strong, broad, slightly rounded and slightly
oblique.
Chest: Deep, broad, capacious but not barrelled. The ribcage to reach
down to the elbow. The ribs are well sprung.
Underline and belly: Underline has a slight rise from sternum to
belly, which has a slight tuck up.

TAIL: The tail is a continuation of the line of the croup, strong at the
root, gradually tapering towards the tip of the tail, set moderately
high. Stretched downwards it should reach the hock joint or be
slightly longer, (ca 2–3 cm. longer. At rest it is carried below the
topline and usually in the shape of a sabre or hook. When the dog is
alert the tail is carried above the topline, either in a sickle shape, ring
or rolled, in case of the latter it may lean on to the back. It is
profusely covered with hair. There are also dogs, which are born tail
less or with a short tail, which is permitted.

### LIMBS



### FOREQUARTERS:


General appearance: In good proportion to the body. The height of
the forearms from the ground to the elbow is ca 50% of the height to
the withers. The bone is strong but not coarse and with strong
musculature.



FCI-St. N° 277  / 27.05.2015
The imagine line which goes through the shoulders, the elbows, the
axis of the forearm and the foot is parallel with the middle body axis
of the dog and vertical to the ground.

body, forming an angle of 90–110 degrees with the upper arm, which
allows the elbow normal movements. The muscle tone is strongly
developed.
Upper arm: Well connected to the body, well muscled and strong,
sloping in an angle of 50 degrees to the horizontal line. Parallel seen
from front.
Elbow: Well fitting to the body.

line with the middle axis of the body. Parallel seen from front. The
bone is strong and has to be in proportion to the body.
Carpus (Wrist): In extension of the vertical forearm line, elastic; the
pisiform bone should be well pronounced.
Metacarpus (Pastern): Short and elastic. Seen from the front, it
should be on the same line as the forearm axis. In profile it is slightly
sloping.

FCI-St. N° 277  / 27.05.2015



GAIT/MOVEMENT: The reach is substantial and with a strong
drive. The movement has to be harmonious; there must be no
twitching. During action the back has to keep preferably still. The
limbs neither to cross over nor be lifted high. The trot is the preferred
gait, as it tires the dog the least when working with livestock.

SKIN: The skin on head has to be tight and must not show any
wrinkles. Elastic and thin, especially in the area of the ears and the
forearms. The skin has to be well fitting to the body and pigmented
in a slate colour.

of the lips, the pads, the nails, the area of the anus, in females also
the part of the vulva have to be pigmented black. The inside of the
lips must also be well pigmented as well as the gum, the darker the
better.

### COAT


Hair: Profuse, dense, relatively soft of good quality, this means that it
is neither woolly nor harsh to the touch. It consists of a topcoat and
an undercoat. The topcoat is wavy to curly with a length of 6–14 cm;
it is a stand off and elastic coat. There must be no parting on the
back.
The undercoat is dense, compact and soft; together with the topcoat it
forms an excellent protecting cover for the dog. Long hair to be
found on the neck (mane), on the back, on the croup, the rib area, on
the back part of the forearms (fringes), trousers on the hind legs
(culottes) as well as on the tail (flag), unless the tail is short. The
longest coat is at the culottes and near the root of the tail. At the
parting between the short hair on forehead and the longer hair on
back of skull, length is around 3,5 cm.
The short hair is straight with a length of 1–1,7 cm. It is on the
muzzle, the forehead, on the ears, around the eyes, on the cheeks, on
the front part of the forelegs and also on Carpus and Metacarpus.


FCI-St. N° 277  / 27.05.2015
On the hind legs the hair is short on the feet and from the Metatarsus
to the hock. Females usually have slightly shorter hair and less
profuse coat than males.

Colour: The colour is black.  A few white hairs, evenly spread over
the basic colour (provided they are hardly visible) are allowed. White
strands as well as body or leg coat, which is completely inter weaved
with white hair is not permitted. White marking on the chest is
permitted, provided it is small (maximum 5 cm.). White markings on
any other body parts are not allowed. The undercoat is definitely
black. During the shedding of the coat, the undercoat often goes
greyish or sometimes even shows a brown tinge, which is not a fault.

Height at the withers: Males:     45–50 cm.
Females:
43–48 cm.
Height difference of +/- 3 cm in males and females of excellent type
and conformation is tolerated.

### FAULTS:


Any departure from the foregoing points should be considered a fault
and the seriousness with which the fault should be regarded should
be in exact proportion to its degree and its effect upon the health and
welfare of the dog and its ability to perform its traditional work.
