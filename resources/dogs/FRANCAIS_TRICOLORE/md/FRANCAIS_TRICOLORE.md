• Light eyes.
• Leathers too flat, too short or set too high.
• Legs badly positioned or thin.
• Hocks too straight.
• Fat feet.
• Any apparent trace of English hound blood, especially in the
head. "Smoky" coloured heads which indicate cross-breeding
with the White and Black Hound and all other colours than, those
above   mentioned.

• Any dog clearly showing physical or behavioural abnormalities.

### N.B.:


• Male animals should have two apparently normal testicles fully

descended into the scrotum.

conformation should be used for breeding.
