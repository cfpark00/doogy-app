BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: The Russian Black Terrier was
created in Russia during the late 1940s and the early 1950s by selective
interbreeding of breeds like the Rottweiler, Giant Schnauzer, Airedale
Terrier and Newfoundland Dog. The Giant Schnauzer is considered to be
the main ancestor of the breed. The initial breeding was supervised by the
military cynological school outside Moscow and the dogs were based in
their kennels named “Red Star”. The aim of the creators of the breed was
the development of a large, brave, strong and manageable working dog
with pronounced guarding instinct; a dog which could be useful for many
services and adapts well to various climate conditions. The breed was
recognized by the FCI in 1984.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: The Russian Black Terrier is a large dog
with a slightly long body and very athletic built of a robust type and hardy
constitution. The breed has qualities like massive bone and powerful
muscles.
It is symmetrical with a large head and compact body and a voluminous
and deep chest. Differences between the sexes to be clearly defined.



FCI-St. N° 327  / 10.01.2011
IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS:  The length of the body is slightly
longer than the height at the withers, could be more pronounced in
females.
Depth of chest should not be less than half the height at the withers.
Length of head should not be less than 40 % of the dog’s height at the
withers. The muzzle is slightly shorter than the skull.

BEHAVIOUR AND TEMPERAMENT: A dignified and confident dog;
well controlled in all situations. When circumstances require, he
immediately assumes an active-defensive posture, however, quickly calms
down at the disappearance of threat. This handsome breed is amiable and
has great endurance; it is undemanding, smart and friendly. It adapts well
to training and various climate conditions and is hard working and
reliable.
