BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: In the Flemish dialect,
Schipperke means « little shepherd ». The common ancestor of the
Belgian Shepherds and the Schipperke was probably a sheepdog
called Leuvenaar, an early breed, usual1y rather small and black. The
Schipperke's origins go back to the 17th century. About 1690, the
Schipperke was the favourite dog of working people and cobblers
from the St.Gery quarter of Brussels, who used to organise
competitions to show off the intricately worked brass collars with
which they adorned their dogs. Its tail was completely docked, a
fashion which seems to have existed since the 15th century. It was
renowned as a catcher of mice, rats, moles and other vermin. The
Schipperke was shown for the first time in 1882 in the town of Spa.
It became fashionable thanks to Queen Marie-Henriette of Belgium.
It was introduced into Great Britain and the U.S.A. in 1887. The first
standard was drawn up in 1888 by the breed club, founded that year,
which is the oldest breed club in Belgium. Over the years great
efforts have had to be made to unify the type. Indeed at that time


FCI-St. N° 083  / 20. 01. 2010
there was discussion about the different varieties coming from
Anvers, Louvain and Brussels.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: Lupoid. The Schipperke is a
sheepdog of small dimensions but very solidly built.
Its head is wedge-shaped with a quite well-developed skull, and a
relatively short muzzle. Its body is well-balanced, short, quite broad
and stocky but its limbs are fine-boned. Its coat is very characteristic,
well-furnished and with straight hair, forming a ruff, a mane, a frill
and culottes which give it its truly unique outline. The difference
between the sexes is evident. Its straightforward morphology, allied
to its sheepdog characteristics and temperament, and added to its
small size, explains its great popularity which extends well beyond
the Belgian borders.

### IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS:


•
Height at withers equals length of body, hence this is a
squarely built dog.
•
Chest comes down level with elbows.
•
Muzzle is definitely less long than half the length of the
head.

BEHAVIOUR/TEMPERAMENT: An excellent small guard dog,
an exceptional alarm, bubbling with vitality, aloof with strangers.
Active and busy, agile, tireless, perpetual1y interested in what is
going on around it, inclined to snap if anyone approaches objects it
has been given to guard, very gentle with children, always curious to
know what is going on behind a closed door or behind an object
which is being moved, showing its reaction by its high-pitched bark,
its raised mane and hackles. It is an inquisitive dog which will hunt
rats, moles and other vermin.

HEAD: Lupoid, wedge-shaped, but not too long and wide enough to
balance with the body. Brows and cheek bones are moderately
arched. Transition from cranial region to facial region is visible but
must not be too pronounced.



FCI-St. N° 083  / 20. 01. 2010
CRANIAL REGION: Quite a wide forehead, narrowing towards the
eyes, slightly rounded when seen in profile. The toplines of the skull
and the muzzle are parallel.
Stop: Pronounced but not exaggerated.

### FACIAL REGION:


Nose: Smal1, nose leather always black.
Muzzle: Tapering towards the nose; well-chiselled, not too long, and
not truncated; length approximately 40 per cent of the total length of
the head; rectilinear foreface.
Lips: Black, close-fitting.
Jaws/Teeth: Healthy, well-set teeth. Scissor bite, pincer bite
tolerated. Complete dentition according to the dental formula. The
lack of one or two premolars 1 (1PM1 or 2PM1) or of a premolar 2
(1PM2) is tolerated and the molars 3 (M3) are not taken into
consideration.
Cheeks: Clean, blending imperceptibly into the sides of the muzzle.

EYES: Dark brown in colour, small, almond-shaped, neither sunken
nor protruding; sharp, lively and mischievous look, black-rimmed
eyelids.

EARS: Erect, very small, pointed, triangular (as far as possible
equilateral), set high but not too close to each other, firm and
extremely mobile.

NECK: Strong, powerfully muscled and appearing very voluminous
because of the abundant hair on the ruff, medium length, well-set
into shoulders, carried well and higher when dog is alert, upper line
being slightly arched.

BODY: Short and wide, therefore cobby, but not overbulky or
heavy, ideally fitting into a square; its length from point of shoulder
to point of buttock is roughly equal to height at withers.
Topline: The topline of the back and loin is straight and firm, often
rising slightly from croup to withers.
Withers: Very pronounced and seeming even more so because of the
mane.


FCI-St. N° 083  / 20. 01. 2010
Back: Short, straight and strong.
Loins: Short, broad and powerful.
Croup: Short, broad and horizontal; the rear section of the croup i.e.
the junction between the croup and the point of the buttocks is
pleasingly rounded, a shape known as a Guinea pig rump.
Chest: Well let down to the elbows; broad in front and also behind
the shoulders, therefore having a good spring of rib. In profile the
forechest is prominent.
Underline and belly: The underline of the chest well-let down,
reaching the elbows, harmoniously and gently rising towards the
belly, which has a moderate tuck-up, neither pendulous nor
whippety.

TAIL: Set high. Some dogs are born completely tailless or with a
rudimentary or incomplete tail (stumpy or short tail). They
should not be penalized for this. At rest a natural tail (reaching
at least to the hock), is preferably hanging down and can be
raised when the dog is moving, carried in line with the topline,
but preferably not higher. A curled tail or a tail carried over the
back is accepted.

LIMBS: Fine-boned and set well beneath the body.

### FOREQUARTERS:


General appearance: The front legs are upright viewed from all sides
and are perfectly parallel when seen from the front; their length from
the ground to the elbow equals approximately half the height at the
withers.
Shoulders: Long and sloping, normal shoulder angulation.
Upper arm: Long and adequately sloping.
Elbows: Strong, neither turning in nor out.
Forearm: Straight, quite well-set apart when seen from the front.
Carpus (Wrist): Strong and not prominent.
Metacarpus (Pastern): Quite short, seen from the front continuing the
line of the forearm, in profile at most very slightly sloping.
Forefeet: Smal1, round and tight (cat feet), arched toes, short, strong
nails, always black.



FCI-St. N° 083  / 20. 01. 2010

### HINDQUARTERS:


General appearance: The hindquarters must be placed under the body
and be perfectly parallel when viewed from behind.
Thigh: Long, strongly muscled, seeming even wider than they are
because of the thickness of the culotte.
Stifle: Approximately in line with the hip; normal angulations.
Lower thigh: Approximately the same length as the thighs.
Hock joint: Well angulated, without exaggeration.
Metatarsus (Rear Pastern): Rather short; dewclaws not desirable.
Hind feet: Like front feet or marginally longer.

GAIT/MOVEMENT: Movement at the trot is supple and firm with
a reasonable reach and good rear thrust, the topline remaining
horizontal and the limbs moving parallel; the front movement should
be in harmony with the rear movement and the elbows must not turn
out. At faster speed the limbs converge.

SKIN: Tight fitting over the whole body.

### COAT


Hair: The top coat is abundant, thick, straight and sufficiently harsh,
with quite firm texture, therefore dry and resistant to the touch,
forming an excellent protection together with the soft thick
undercoat. Very short hair on the ears, short hair on the head, the
front part of the front legs, the hocks and rear pasterns. On the body,
the average length hair is close-lying. Around the neck the hair is
much longer and more off-standing, beginning at the outer edges of
the ears, forming, especial1y in the male but also in the female, a
wide and very typical ruff (long hair around the neck, in tufts on each
side), a “mane” (long hair on the top of the neck, continuing as far as
the withers and the shoulders) and a frill (long hair on the underside
of the neck and on the chest, stretching between the forelegs and
gradually fading away under the chest). On the back of the thighs
long and abundant hair covering the anal region, with tips angled
inward in a very typical way, form the culottes. The tail is furnished
with hair the same length as that on the body.



FCI-St. N° 083  / 20. 01. 2010


Colour: Totally black. The undercoat need not be completely black
but can also be dark grey provided it is totally hidden by the top coat.
A little greying for example on the muzzle due to age is tolerated.

### SIZE AND WEIGHT:


Weight:
Between 3 and 9 kg. An average weight of 4 to 7 kg is sought after.
