St-FCI n° 296 / 15.09.2021

ORIGIN:  Great Britain.

### DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THE OFFICIAL VALID



### STANDARD: 27.07.2021.



UTILIZATION: Sheepdog.

FCI-CLASSIFICATION:  Group  1 Sheepdogs and Cattle



Dogs (except Swiss Cattle



Dogs).

Section 1 Sheepdogs.

Without working trial.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: Appears as gifted with intelligence,
alertness and activity. Stands with dignity governed by perfect
anatomical formation, with no part out of proportion, giving
appearance of working capability. Physical structure on lines of
strength and activity, free from cloddiness and with no trace of
coarseness. Expression most important. In considering relative
values, it is obtained by perfect balance and combination of skull and
foreface, size and shape, colour and placement of eye, correct
position and carriage of ears.

IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS: Viewed in profile, top of skull
and top of muzzle lie in two parallel, straight lines of equal length
divided by a slight, but perceptible stop or break.
Body slightly long compared with height.

BEHAVIOUR/TEMPERAMENT: Friendly disposition with no
trace of nervousness or aggressiveness.

HEAD: Head properties of great importance, must be considered in
proportion to size of dog. Viewed from front or side, head resembles
a well-blunted, clean wedge, being smooth in outline.
A mid-point between inside corners of eyes (which is centre of a
correctly placed stop) is centre of balance in length of head.



St-FCI n° 296 / 15.09.2021


### CRANIAL REGION:


Skull: Flat. Sides taper gradually and smoothly from ears to end of
nose. Depth of skull from brow to underpart of jaw never excessive
(deep through).
Stop: Slight, but perceptible. The mid-point between inside corner of
eyes is centre of a correctly placed stop or break.

### FACIAL REGION:


Nose: Always black.
Muzzle: End of smooth, well rounded muzzle blunt, never square.
Muzzle not pinched.
Jaws/teeth: Teeth of good size. Jaws strong with a perfect, regular
and complete scissor bite, i.e. upper teeth closely overlapping lower
teeth and set square to the jaws. Underjaw strong, clean cut.
Cheek:  Cheek bones not prominent.

EYES: Very important feature, giving sweet expression. Medium
size (never very small), set somewhat obliquely, of almond-shape
and dark brown colour, except in case of Blue Merles, when eyes are
frequently (one or both, or part of one or both) blue or blue-flecked.
Expression full of intelligence, with quick, alert look when listening.

EARS: Moderately large, wider at base, and placed not too close
together nor too much on side of head. When in repose carried
thrown back, but on alert brought forward and carried semi-erect,
that is, with approximately two-thirds of ear standing erect, top third
tipping forward naturally, below horizontal.

NECK: Muscular, powerful, of fair length, well arched.

### BODY:


Back: Level and firm.
Loin: With slight rise.
Chest: Deep and fairly broad behind shoulders. Ribs well sprung.


St-FCI n° 296 / 15.09.2021

TAIL: Long with bone reaching at least to hock joint. To be carried
low when quiet but with a slight upward swirl at tip. May be carried
gaily when excited, but never over back.

### LIMBS



### FOREQUARTERS:


General appearance: Forelegs straight and muscular, with a moderate
amount of bone.
Shoulder: Sloping shoulders, well laid back. Good return of
upper arm placing elbow below withers.
Elbow: Turning neither in nor out.
Forelegs straight and muscular. Moderate bone.
Forearm: Somewhat fleshy.
Metacarpus (Pasterns): Showing flexibility without weakness.
Forefeet: Oval soles well padded. Toes arched and close together.

### HINDQUARTERS:


Thigh: Muscular. Hindlegs clean and sinewy below thighs.
Stifle: Well bent.
Metatarsus (Rear pasterns): Well let down and powerful.
Hind feet: Oval soles well padded. Toes arched and close together.
Hindfeet slightly less arched.


GAIT/ MOVEMENT: Distinctly characteristic of this breed. A
sound dog is never out at elbow, yet moves with front feet
comparatively close together. Plaiting, crossing or rolling are highly
undesirable. Hindlegs, from hock joint to ground, when viewed from
rear, parallel. Hindlegs powerful and full of drive. Viewed from side,
action is smooth. A reasonably long stride is desirable and should be
light and appear quite effortless.

### COAT



Hair: Short, flat, top coat of harsh texture, with very dense undercoat.
Not trimmed or clipped.


St-FCI n° 296 / 15.09.2021

Colour: Three recognized colours: Sable and white, Tricolour and
Blue Merle.
•
Sable: Any shade of light gold to rich mahogany or shaded
sable.
Light straw or cream colour highly
undesirable.
•
Tricolour: Predominantly black with rich tan markings about
legs and head. A rusty tinge in top coat highly undesirable.
•
Blue Merle: Predominantly clear, silvery blue, splashed and
marbled with black. Rich tan markings preferred, but
absence should not be penalised. Large black markings, slate
colour, or rusty tinge in top or undercoat are highly
undesirable.
All colours above may carry typical white Collie markings to a
greater or lesser degree. Following markings are favourable: white
collar, full or part; white front, legs and feet; white tail tip. A blaze
may be carried on muzzle or skull. White markings not to extend
behind withers or above the hock.  All white or predominantly
white is most undesirable.

### SIZE AND WEIGHT:


Height at withers: Males:
56-61 cm


Females:
51-56 cm
Weight:
Males:
20,5-29,5 kg

Females:
18,0-25,0 kg


FAULTS: Any departure from the foregoing points should be considered
a fault and the seriousness with which the fault should be regarded should
be in exact proportion to its degree and its effect upon the health and
welfare of the dog and on its ability to perform its traditional work.
