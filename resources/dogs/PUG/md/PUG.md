BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: A certain amount of
speculation has taken place regarding the origin of this breed, which
would seem to have come from the Orient. His home country is listed
as China, where snub-nosed dogs have always been in favour. He
found his way to Europe with traders of the Dutch East India Company
and as far back as the 1500s was being admired in the Netherlands. In
fact, the Pug became the symbol for the royal patriots.
The Pug arrived in England when William III came to the throne. Until
1877 the breed was seen here only in fawn but in that year a black pair
was introduced from the Orient.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: Decidedly square and cobby, it is
“multum in parvo” shown in compactness of form, well-knit
proportions and hardness of muscle, but never to appear either low on
legs or leggy.

IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS: Decidedly square and cobby.

BEHAVIOUR AND TEMPERAMENT: Great charm, dignity and
intelligence. Even-tempered, happy and lively disposition.

### HEAD



Relatively large and in proportion to body, round, not apple-headed.

### CRANIAL REGION:


Skull: With no indentation. Wrinkles on forehead clearly defined
without exaggeration.

### FACIAL REGION:


Nose: Black with fairly large well opened nostrils. Pinched nostrils
and heavy over nose wrinkle is unacceptable and should be heavily
penalised.
Muzzle: Relatively short, blunt, square, not upfaced. Eyes or nose
never adversely affected or obscured by over nose wrinkle.
Jaws / Teeth: Slightly undershot. Wide lower jaw with incisors almost
in a straight line. Wry mouth, teeth or tongue showing all highly
undesirable and should be heavily penalised.

EYES: Dark, relatively large, round in shape, soft and solicitous in
expression, very lustrous, and when excited, full of fire. Never
protruding, exaggerated or showing white when looking straight
ahead. Free from obvious eye problems.

EARS: Thin, small, soft like black velvet.  Two kinds – “Rose ear” -
small drop-ear which folds over and back to reveal the burr.  “Button
ear” - ear flap folding forward, tip lying close to skull to cover
opening.  Preference given to latter.

NECK: Slightly arched to resemble a crest, strong, thick with enough
length to carry head proudly.

BODY: Short and cobby.  Should be hard of muscle. Substance
must not be confused with obesity which is highly undesirable.
Topline: Level, neither roached nor dipping.
Chest: Broad in chest. Ribs well sprung and carried well back.

TAIL: High-set, tightly curled over hip. Double curl highly desirable.

FAULTS: Any departure from the foregoing points should be
considered a fault and the seriousness with which the fault should be
regarded should be in exact proportion to its degree and its effect upon
