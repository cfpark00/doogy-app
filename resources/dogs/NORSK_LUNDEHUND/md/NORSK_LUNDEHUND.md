BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMAR: The Norwegian Lundehund
is an ancient breed used for hunting seabirds on the Norwegian
coast. The breed name is a combination of the Norwegian words
"lunde" (puffin, i.e. Fratercula arctica) and "hund", dog.
Although the age of a breed is difficult to establish, there are
descriptions of dogs used for hunting puffins which are more
than 400 years old.  The Lundehund was important for people in
coastal Norway.  The dog’s unique anatomy with extra,
functional toes, a neck that can bend to touch the back, ears that
can close and forelimbs that are ultra flexible, enables the dog to
climb near vertical screes and enter the narrow, twisting
burrows of the puffins nesting cavities and retrieve the birds
alive.
Puffin meat was a main part of the diet during winter in costal
areas. The down was either used in duvets and pillows or
exported. Modern hunting methods and depopulation in
northern coastal regions caused a decrease in the Lundehund
population.
However, at Måstad on the isolated island of Værøy, people kept
the hunting traditions alive, using the Lundehunds. Between the
World Wars, some dogs were sent to a Mr.& Mrs Christie in
southern Norway and bred from.



FCI-St. N°265 / 22.02.2012


### Canine distemper nearly wiped out the entire Lundehund


population between the World Wars and immediately after WW
II, but the Christie’s in cooperation with people of Værøy and
some new breeders, managed to save the breed from extinction.
Today the puffin is a protected species and the dogs cannot be
used for their original purpose.  They are however much
treasured and part of the Norwegian cultural heritage.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: Spitz type dog, small, rectangular,
supple, rather lightly; morphological characteristics different
according to sex.

### CRANIAL REGION:


Skull: Slightly rounded with prominent superciliary arches.
Stop: Pronounced, but without excess.

### FACIAL REGION:


Muzzle: Wedge shaped of medium length. Nasal bridge slightly
convex.
Jaws / Teeth: Scissor bite preferred, but a pincer bite or a moderate
prognathism of the lower jaw is permitted.  The absence of premolars
on both sides, in each jaw, is accepted.

EYES: Slightly sloping and not protruding; the iris is yellowish
brown; the pupil is encircled by a dark halo.

EARS: Triangular ears of medium size, broad at the base, carried
erect and very mobile.
The cartilage of the ear lobe has the faculty of being able to retract
itself so that the ear folds itself and flops in a specific manner, either
backwards or in right angle upwards, so as to close the auditory
passage.
