BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: This breed originated from
medium-sized dogs that existed in Japan in the ancient times.  It
became established as a breed in the Kai district (Yamanashi
Prefecture), which is surrounded by mountains.  Another name for
this breed is « Kai tora-ken ».  A distinguishing feature in this dog is
its brindled coat.  These dogs are used mainly for hunting wild boar
and deer.  Their strong inclination to form a pack is thought to
contribute towards maintaining the purity of the breed.  The breed
was designated as a « natural monument » in 1934.

sturdily built, muscles well developed.  The dog has the
characteristics of a dog living in mountainous districts of Japan.

IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS: The ratio of height at withers to
length of body is 10 : 11, but the body can be slightly longer in
bitches.
