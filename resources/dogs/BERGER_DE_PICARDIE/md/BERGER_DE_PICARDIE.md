BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: The Picardy Sheepdog has
very ancient origins. Of course it is not certain that the Picardy
Shepherd originates strictly from the Picardie region; it is possible,
even probable, that it was widerspread as harsh-coated sheep and
cattle dogs were typical throughout north west Europe.
In 1863, the first Picardies were judged at a show in the same class
as Beaucerons and Briards.  In 1898 it became evident that the
Picardy was a breed.  Paul Megnin drafted the first standard in 1922.
The breed obtained definitive recognition in 1925.
The breed stagnated somewhat until the second world war and it was
only afterwards that fanciers, who wanted to revive interest in the
breed, began searching in Picardie, at the source, for the most typical
subjects for breeding.
After many years, during which the Breed Club had difficulties in
obtaining official recognition, Mr Robert Montenot, an eminent dog
specialist, created the “Les Amis du Berger Picard” Club in 1955.





St-FCI n°176/04.08.2010
The club obtained definitive recognition in 1959 and a new breed
standard was approved by the S.C.C. in 1964. The present standard
was drawn up by Mr. J.C. Larive, President of the Club, and his
committee in collaboration with Mr. R. Triquet.

### GENERAL APPEARANCE:


The Picardy Shepherd is a medium-sized dog. It is solid, hardy, well
muscled and well built without ever being heavy. It remains very
elegant whether standing or in action.
Its lively and alert expression is characterized by its rugged
appearance.

### IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS:


The Picardy Sheepdog is mediolinear (of medium proportions). The
length of the body, from the point of the shoulder to the point of
buttock, should be slightly more than the height at the withers (from
5 to 8%). Females are generally a little longer than males.

The skull and muzzle are of equal length.

The distance from the elbow to the ground is equal to half the height
at withers.

BEHAVIOUR/TEMPERAMENT:  The Picardy Sheepdog is even
tempered. It is neither aggressive, shy nor nervous. It should be both
obedient and fearless. These qualities enable it to easily accomplish
its work which consists of driving and protecting flocks of sheep. It
is also a very good guard for the home and an excellent family dog
who enjoys close contact with children.

HEAD: Without being heavy, it should be in proportion to the size.
Delicately chiselled, it should not give the impression of being
pointed.





St-FCI n°176/04.08.2010
Seen from the side, the lines of the skull and muzzle are parallel.
The type is stamped by the rugged aspect; distinct eyebrows (hair
approximately 4cm long and which should not veil the eyes) along
with beard and moustaches.

### CRANIAL REGION:


Skull: Seen from the front, the forehead should not be flat but
slightly convex, with a minimal depression in the middle.
Stop: Only slightly defined; it is placed at equal distance from the
occiput and the tip of the nose.

### FACIAL REGION:


Nose: Well developed. Always black, well opened nostrils.
Muzzle: Strong and not too long. It should not end in a point. The
nosebridge is straight. Presence of thin beard and moustaches.
Cheeks: Should be moderately round.
Lips: Thin and tight-fitting.
Teeth: Powerful jaws. Scissors bite. Dentition should be complete.

EYES: Horizontal, of medium size, oval, not prominent, dark colour
(the colour can be more or less dark depending on that of the coat,
but never lighter than hazel).

EARS: Of moderate size, wide at set-on, high set, always carried
naturally erect with slightly rounded tips. A diverging carriage is
tolerated, but not sought after.

### NECK:


Strong and muscled, of reasonable length, springing cleanly from the
shoulders to allow for proud carriage.

### BODY:


The bone structure is solid, without exaggeration, and the muscles
are lean.
Back: Straight.
Loin: Strong.
Croup: Sloping slightly and progressively into the buttocks.



St-FCI n°176/04.08.2010



Chest: Reaches the elbows but not beyond. The correct chest
perimeter measurement, taken immediately behind the elbows, is
superior by 1/5th to the height at withers. The ribs are well sprung at
the top then gradually flatten towards the sternum.
Underline & Belly: Slightly tucked up.

TAIL:  Naturally long.
At rest, it should reach the point of the hock joint and be slightly
curved at the tip.
In action, it can be carried higher but never over the back.
The hair on the tail is the same length as that on the body.
