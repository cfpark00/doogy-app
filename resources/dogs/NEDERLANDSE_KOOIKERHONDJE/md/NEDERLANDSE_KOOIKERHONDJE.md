Section 2 Flushing Dogs.

Without working trial.

BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: In 1942, during the Second
World War, the Baroness Van Hardenbroek van Ammerstol began to
recreate the Kooikerhondje. She gave a picture of the type of dog she
was looking for to a pedlar and asked him to look out for such dogs.
At a farm in the province of Friesland he found the bitch now well
known as Tommy. She became the founding bitch of the
Kooikerhondje. In 1966 the Raad van Beheer adopted the interim
breed and in 1971 the breed was officially recognized.
The Kooikerhondje was and still is used in the duck decoys. His task
is still to lure the ducks into the decoy with his gaily waving tail; he
does not hunt the ducks. He calmly moves between the decoyscreens in order to provoke the ducks curiosity and lure them further
down the decoy pipe where the ducks are captured in a trap. They are
either killed for the table or ringed for ornithological research.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: The Kooikerhondje is a harmoniously
built orange-red parti-coloured small sporting dog of almost square
body proportions.




FCI-St. N° 314  / 19.01.2011
He moves with his head held high; in action the well-feathered
waving tail is carried level with, or above the topline. The ears have
black hair at the tip, the so-called earrings.  The dog is presented
with a natural, untrimmed coat.

### IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS:


The length of the body from the point of the shoulder (at the
scapula/humerus) to the point of the buttocks may be slightly longer
than the height at the withers. Skull and muzzle are of about equal
length.

### BEHAVIOUR AND TEMPERAMENT:


Lively and agile, self-confident and with sufficient perseverance and
stamina, good natured and alert, however not noisy. The breed is
faithful, easy-going and friendly.
Outside the hunting season the dog is expected to find and kill
vermin, hence he needs to be keen, swift and tough. He is a true
sporting dog, being attentive and energetic and having a zest for
working and with a cheerful character.

### HEAD


The head is of moderate length, fitting in with the general
appearance, clean-cut, with flowing lines.

### CRANIAL REGION:


Skull: Sufficiently broad, moderately rounded.
Stop: Seen in profile clearly visible but not too deep.

### FACIAL REGION:


Nose: Black and well developed.
Muzzle: Seen from the side not too deep and slightly wedge-shaped;
seen from above not tapering too much and well-filled under the
eyes.
Lips: Preferably well-pigmented, close-fitting and not overhanging.
Jaws / Teeth: Scissor bite; complete dentition is desirable. Pincer bite
is accepted but less desirable.

EYES: Almond-shaped, dark brown with a friendly, alert expression.


FCI-St. N° 314  / 19.01.2011
EARS: Moderately large, set on just above the line from the point of
the nose to the corner of the eye.
The ears are carried close to the cheeks without a fold. Well
feathered; black hair tips (“earrings”) are highly desirable.

NECK: Strongly muscled, of sufficient length and clean-cut.

### BODY:


Topline: Smooth line from the withers to the tail.
Back: Strong and straight, rather short.
Loin: Of sufficient length and width, strongly muscled.
Croup: Slightly sloping and sufficiently broad; the length of the
croup should be 1.5 times the width.
Chest: Reaching to the elbows with sufficient spring of ribs.
Sufficiently developed forechest.
Underline and belly: Slight tuck-up towards the loin.

TAIL: Set on so as to follow the topline of the body, carried level
with the topline or almost straight up (gaily). Well-feathered with a
white plume. The last vertebra should reach the hock joint.

### LIMBS



### FOREQUARTERS:


Shoulder: Shoulder sufficiently sloping in order to create a flowing
line from neck to back.
Upper arm: Well-angulated towards shoulder blade that is of equal
length.
Elbow: Close to the body.
Forearm: Straight and parallel, strong bone of sufficient density and
length.
Metacarpus (Pastern): Strong and slightly oblique.

FCI-St. N° 314  / 19.01.2011


### HINDQUARTERS:


General appearance: Well angulated, straight and parallel seen from
the rear. Strong bone.
Thigh: Well muscled.
Lower thigh: Length equal to thigh.
Hock joint: Well let down.
Hind feet: As forefeet.

GAIT / MOVEMENT: Should be flowing and springy, well
extended, with good drive. Limbs parallel.

### COAT:


Hair: Of medium length, slightly wavy or straight and close lying.
Soft hair. Well-developed undercoat.
Front legs should have moderate feathering reaching to the pastern
joints. Hind legs should have fairly long feathered breeches; no
feathering below the hock joints. The coat on the head, the front part
of the legs and the feet should be short. Sufficiently feathered on the
underside of the tail. Longer hair on throat and forechest. Earrings
(long feathered black hairtips) are highly desirable.

Colour: Distinct patches of clear orange-red colour on pure white
although a few small spots on the legs are accepted. The orange-red
colour should be predominant. Some black hair intermingling with
the orange-red colour and a slight form of ticking are accepted but
less desirable.
Colouring on the head: A clearly visible blaze running down to the
nose. There should be colouring on the cheeks and around the eyes.
A blaze that is too narrow or too wide or only partly coloured cheeks
is less desirable. A black tail ring where the colour changes from
orange-red to white is permitted.

Ideal height at the withers: Males:  40 cms.

Females: 38 cms.

Tolerance: 2 cms over or 3 cms under

the ideal heights are permitted.



FCI-St. N° 314  / 19.01.2011
FAULTS: Any departure from the foregoing points should be
considered a fault and the seriousness with which the fault should be
regarded should be in exact proportion to its degree and the
functional health and welfare of the dog and on its ability to perform
its traditional work.

Ears too small.
•
Ears half-erect, “flying ears”.
•
Tail that is curled.
•
Hackney gait.
•
