FCI-St. N° 193/ 05.11.2019
TRANSLATION:  Anna Samsonova.  Edited

Yerusalimsky.

ORIGIN: Russia.

### DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THE ORIGINAL VALID



### STANDARD: 04.09.2019.



UTILIZATION: Hunting sighthound, racing and coursing hound.
Borzoi is a hunting sighthound to be used mostly for chasing hare and
fox, less for wolf hunting. Combines high agility with endurance and
the ability to tackle a game deftly at once. Successfully used for
coursing and racing.

FCI-CLASSIFICATION:  Group  10 Sighthounds.
Section 1  Long-haired or fringed
Sighthounds.
Without working trial.

BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: The history of the Borzoi dated
from the XV century, to the Mongol invasion. The Tatars used
sighthound of Arab origin – Koutsi, while the Russian hunters did not
have sighthounds; when hunting they used extraordinary strong
Loshaya dogs, who were able to catch and kill a deer or even an elk.
Koutsi and Loshaya crossbreed dogs became the prototype of the
Borzoi. These dogs were depicted on the prayer book belonging to
Grand Prince Vasily III, Ivan the Terrible father. In XVI–XVII
centuries new bloods of Polsky Chart (Polish Greyhound) added the
nobility to their descendants. Having grown the fame of these dogs
crossed the borders of the Russian Empire.
Further development of the breed was influenced by crossbreed with
the Klock – a huge, strong and fierce bearded Courland Sighthound.
Their descendants became dogs without beards, with long, fine hair.
They marked the beginning of “Gustopsovy” Borzoi type.




FCI-St. N° 193/ 05.11.2019
The bloods of Greyhound added to the breed at the same time initiated
the appearance of “Chistopsovy” Borzoi type. Bloods of Mountain
(Gorsky) and Crimean Sighthounds known by their endurance were
used later.
The Borzoi became the result of this multi-breed crossing. The
vigilance, agility and expedition of the Borzoi in pursuing the game,
its ability to flash-like rush, to tackle the game deftly at once, its
savageness and courage, all these important qualities proved out to be
very useful when hunting the game in short in irregular terrain. The
Borzois were also successfully used for hunting in steppes, where it
was required to work on longer distances.
Hunt with large packs of sighthounds and hounds and with special
horses – “hunters” – appeared in the XVIII–XIX centuries. Such hunts
consisted of up to several hundred dogs and differed from one another
in type and working abilities. The Pershino hunt by Grand Duke
Nikolai Nikolaevich was especially renowned, for both the exquisite
beauty of the dogs, and their speed and passion for the game.
The first Congress of Borzois lovers was organized in 1874, but only
in 1888 the Moscow Hunting Society adopted the first standard of the
Borzoi, where a type of the Borzoi was unified after all.
N.P. Yermolov was the author of this standard. The fundamental
principles of this standard still remain the same despite changes made
in the XX and XXI centuries – in 1925, 1939, 1951, 1963, 1969, 1980,
1993, 1995 and 2006 years.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: Dog of aristocratic appearance, tall,
lean and strong, harmoniously built, rather high-legged, fairly narrow
in body. Slightly elongated format. Females are longer than males.
Skin is thin, elastic, without folds. Muscles lean, elongated, very well
developed. Bone structure is strong but not massive.

### IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS:


• In males the height at the withers is equal or 1–2 cm more than the
height at the point of sacrum.
• In females these two heights are equal.
• The length of the body somewhat exceeds the height at the withers.


FCI-St. N° 193/ 05.11.2019
• The depth of the chest is equal to almost half of the height at the
withers.
• The height at elbows is slightly superior to half of the height at the
withers.
• The length of the muzzle, from the tip of the nose to the stop, is
slightly superior to that of the skull, from the stop to the occipital
bone.

BEHAVIOUR / TEMPERAMENT: Temperament is calm; visual
response is well evident.
Typical gaits: before the game to be found – slow trot and even walk;
in chasing the game – full gallop.
The attitude towards people is neutral to friendly.

HEAD: Aristocratic, narrow, long, in proportion to the general
appearance; the head is so lean that the principal veins are shown
through the skin. Viewed from the side the top lines of the head form
a long, slightly convex line. Superciliary arches and zygomatic arches
are not pronounced.

### CRANIAL REGION:


Skull: Seen from above, narrow, elongated, oval-shaped. Seen in
profile, almost flat. Occiput is well pronounced.
Stop: Hardly visible.

### FACIAL REGION:


Nose: Large, always black in any coat colour, considerably prominent
in relation to the lower jaw.
Muzzle: Long, lean, well filled out in all its length, straight or slightly
downfaced, slightly arched near the nose. The length of the muzzle,
from the tip of the nose to the stop, is slightly superior to that of the
skull, from the stop to the occiput.
Lips: Tight, well fitting, fine, with black edging whatever the coat
colour.




FCI-St. N° 193/ 05.11.2019
Jaws / Teeth: Teeth white, strong, incisors are closely spaced; canines
are not too wide apart. Scissor bite. Level bite is permitted but not
desirable. Complete dental formula. The absence of 3rd molars (M3)
and one or two P1 is acceptable.
Cheeks: Flat, not pronounced.

EYES: Large, almond-shaped, dark brown to brown; eyelids are with
black edging, tight-fitting.

EARS: Small, thin, mobile, pointed-tipped, covered with short hair.
Set on above the eye level, set closely and backwards, pointing
towards the nape of the neck. The tips of the ears are placed near each
other, directed downwards along the neck and close to it. When the
dog is alert, the ears are carried higher on the cartilages; their tips are
directed sideward or forward. Sometimes one or both ears are erect
like horse ears.

NECK: Long, dry, muscled, slightly arched, oval-shaped (slightly
flattened laterally), of medium set.

### BODY:


Topline: Is a smooth arch.
Withers: Not marked.
Back: Broad, muscled, supple, flexible.
Loin: Rather long, arched, muscled, broad. Together with the back
forms the smooth arch, which is more pronounced in males, than in
females. The highest point of this arch is in its middle, that is the
region of the 1st or 2nd lumbar vertebrae.
Croup: Long, broad, moderately sloping. The width of the croup
measured between the two iliac tubers must not be less than 8 cm.
Chest: Oval in cross-section, deep, not narrow, yet not wider than the
croup, let down almost up to the elbow-joints. Viewed from the side
the forechest is somewhat prominent and places almost at humeroscapula level. In shoulder blades region the chest is rather flat, but
towards the false ribs gets gradually wider. Definitely shortened false
ribs.
Underline and belly: Abruptly tucked up towards the flanks.


FCI-St. N° 193/ 05.11.2019

TAIL: Sickle- or sabre-shaped, thin, long, with dense and abundant
feather. Passed between the hind legs and flanks, it must reach up to
the iliac tuber. When the dog is standing naturally, the tail hangs
downwards. In movement it is raised, but not above the back level.
