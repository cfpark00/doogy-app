BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: This breed goes back to
medium-sized dogs that existed in Japan in ancient times.  The
Shikoku was bred as a hunting dog, mainly for hunting boar in the
mountainous districts of Kochi Prefecture.  It is sometimes called
« Kochi-ken » (ken = dog).  There were three varieties of this breedAwa, Hongawa and Hata-all named after the area where they were
bred.  Among them, the Hongawa maintained the highest degree of
purity, because the breeding area was not easily accessible.
These dogs are tough and sufficiently agile to run through a
montainous region.  They are characterized by their sesame coloured
coats.  The breed took on the name of the region and was designated
as a « natural monument » in 1937.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: A medium-sized dog with well
balanced and well developed clean cut muscles.  It has pricked ears
and a curled or sickle tail.  Conformation : strong, well-boned and
compact.

length of body is 10 : 11.

BEHAVIOUR / TEMPERAMENT: A dog of marked endurance,
keen in sense with a naive feeling, energetic and highly alert; an
enthusiastic hunter; docile towards his master.
