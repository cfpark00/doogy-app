arched, with jet black nails, hare feet undesirable.

GAIT/MOVEMENT: Ideal fore-movement akin to the "extended
trot"; hackney action not desirable; equally a "shuffling gait"
undesirable. Hind action smooth with ease and precision combined
with drive; there should be flowing quality to indicate true
soundness.

COAT: Thick, close and glossy. A density of short hair required.

chestnut deeply rich.
Colours not running or blending into each other, but meeting
abruptly, forming clear and well defined lines of colour division.
Forelegs tanned to knees in front. The tan then continuing inside and
at back of forelegs to point just below elbows; thin black line up each
toe (pencilling) and a clearly defined black mark (thumb mark) on
centre of each pastern, and under chin. Hindlegs well tanned in front
and inside with black bar dividing tan at centre of lower thigh. Heavy
tan on outside of hindquarters (breaching or culottes) undesirable.

muzzle, curving below eyes to base of throat. A tan spot above each
eye and a small tan spot on each cheek. Under jaw and throat tanned,
lip line black. Hair inside ears tan (tan behind ears undesirable). Each
side of chest has some tan. Vent and under root of tail, tan. White
hairs forming a patch anywhere totally undesirable.

SIZE/WEIGHT:  Ideal height 25-30 cm at the shoulder.


Ideal weight 2.7-3.6 kg.


FAULTS: Any departure from the foregoing points should be
considered a fault and the seriousness with which the fault should be
regarded should be in exact proportion to its degree and its effect
upon the health and welfare of the dog.
