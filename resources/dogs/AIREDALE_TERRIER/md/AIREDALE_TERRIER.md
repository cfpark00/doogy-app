BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: The Airedale Terrier is a

that the Airedale Show gave the breed its name. Many ‘Waterside
Terriers’ from the valleys of the rivers Wharfe, Calder and Aire were
exhibited at this show, making up a large entry. He is the largest of
all the terrier breeds and encompasses all the characteristics of this
group of dogs, he is also known as the King of Terriers.
The Airedale Terrier has remarkable scenting powers and has been
used in Africa, India and Canada for tracking, has aided the Red
Cross in times of war and has seen service with police and in the
armed forces of both Britain and Russia.
