ORIGIN: Germany.

### DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THE OFFICIAL VALID



### STANDARD: 24.06.1997.

Group 6     Scenthounds and related


breeds.

Section 1.3   Small sized hounds.

With working trial.

BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY:  From the formerly
numerically strong varieties of the Bracken, the only one surviving in
Germany is the Westphalian Bracke.  Its most significant local
variety was the tricolour Sauerländer Holzbracke.  Through   melting
this type with local Steinbracken, one certain type has evolved,
which since 1900 has been designated as the Deutsche Bracke
(German Bracke / Hound).

IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS: Length of head in dogs of
medium size approximately 21 cm, from muzzle to beween eyes
about 9 cm.

GENERAL APPEARANCE : That  of a  light, high stationed,
elegant,  yet strongly made hunting dog  with a noble, comparatively
fine head, good leathers and  a  well  carried but  in  respect of  the
noble  general appearance,  remarkably  thick  tail.   Slightly tucked
up abdomen.

HEAD: Fine, clean, elongated.  Seen from the front, the head
appears narrow and long, the skull only little broader than the not
sharply protruding cheeks which merge very gradually with the
muzzle.


FCI-St. N° 299 / 15.09.1997

### CRANIAL REGION:


Skull: Slightly domed, occiput protrudes but only slightly.
Stop: Minimal.

### FACIAL REGION:


Nose: Has a light, almost flesh coloured strip in its middle, while
the wings of the nose have more or less dark pigment.
Bridge of nose: Very slightly convex.
Lips: Moderately pendant, corner of mouth small.
Teeth / Bite:  Extremely strong and even.  Incisors meet either on top
of each other or the inside of the upper incisors touches the outside
of the lower incisors.  Canines particularly strongly developed.

EYES: Dark, clear with friendly expression.

EARS: Leathers: Long, about 14 cm and broad, about 9 cm, close
fitting and rounded at ends.

NECK Moderate length and rather strong in relation to the head.

### BODY:


Back: Slightly arched.
Croup: Falling away slightly.
Chest:  Deep, reaching to below elbows.   Flatly rounded with long
ribcage.

TAIL:  Long, not noticeably strong at the root.   As a protection
against knocking against tree trunks and branches, it has bushy long
hair and is therefore comparatively thick, yet tapering to a point and
somewhat brush-like.   Tail is carried hanging down or upwards in a
gentle curve.
