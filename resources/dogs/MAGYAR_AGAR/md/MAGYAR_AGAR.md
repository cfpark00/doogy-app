### MAGYAR AGAR


(Hungarian Greyhound)




FCI-St. N° 240 / 13.09.2000
TRANSLATION: Brought up to date by Dr. Paschoud and Mrs
Elke Peper.  Official language (DE).

ORIGIN: Hungary.

### DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THE OFFICIAL VALID



### STANDARD: 06.04.2000.



UTILIZATION: Hunting and coursing dog which hunts the game
by sight. His nose is nevertheless noteworthy. He is especially skilled
in coursings and race tracks, yielding good results particularly in
longer distances. He is a very good companion and a loyal watch
dog.

FCI-CLASSIFICATION:  Group 10 Sighthounds.


Section 3 Short-haired Sighthounds


Without working trial.

BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: The Magyar Agar is an
original hunting breed. His origin goes back to the times when the
Magyars conquered the country. This is proved by archeological
findings of skull bones. To increase the dog’s speed the breed was
crossed with different sighthound breeds in the 19th century.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: Gives the impression of strength;
bone structure and musculature very strongly developed. Elegant.

### IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS:


•
The length of the body sligthly exceeds the height at the withers.
•
The length of the muzzle is approximately half of the length of
the head.

BEHAVIOUR/TEMPERAMENT:  Untiring, full of stamina, fast,
tough and robust. Excellent on the race-course; he is on some
distances faster than the Greyhound.


FCI-St. N° 240 / 13.09.2000
Somewhat reserved by nature, but not shy, sensible, intelligent and
faithful.   He is watchful; his instinct to protect people and their
houses and property is developed, yet he is not aggressive or vicious.

HEAD: Wedge shaped with a rather broad base, seen from above
and in profile.

### CRANIAL REGION



Skull: Moderately strong, broad; the forehead fairly wide.
Stop: Pronounced.

### FACIAL REGION



Nose: Relatively large, well pigmented; with large, wide open
nostrils.
Muzzle: Strong, elongated, not too pointed.
Lips: Close-fitting, tight, well pigmented.
Jaws/Teeth: Jaws powerful, strong; well developed, strong and
complete scissor bite, according to the dentition formula.
Cheeks: Strong, muscular.
Eyes: Of medium size, dark. Neither deep-set nor protruding. The
expression is keen and intelligent.
Ears: Rather large; their texture is distinctly thick; set on at medium
height, well carried rose ears clinging to the neck. When the dog is
alert, they are raised up. The heavier ears are more desirable than the
light ears. Permanently pricked ears are faulty.

NECK: Medium long, yet elegant, dry, muscular. Without folds.

### BODY


Withers: Well developed, muscular, long.
Back: Broad, straight, firm, very well-muscled.
Loin: Very broad, straight, strongly muscled.

room for the heart and the big lungs. Ribs well arched, extending far
back.
Belly: Moderately tucked up.



FCI-St. N° 240 / 13.09.2000
