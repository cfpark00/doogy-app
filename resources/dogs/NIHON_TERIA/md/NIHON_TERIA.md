BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: This breed was created by

Netherlands in the 17th century, to small-sized pointers or smallsized native dogs. Japanese Terriers were kept mainly as lapdogs in
ports such as Kobe and Yokohama. The Japanese Terrier has a lively
and cheerful character. Its planned breeding started around 1920, and
it was not until about 1930 that its type became fixed.

IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS: The ratio of height at withers to
