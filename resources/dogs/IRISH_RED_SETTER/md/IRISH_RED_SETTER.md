BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: The Irish Red Setter was
developed in Ireland as a working dog for hunting game.  The breed is
derived from the Irish Red and White Setter and an unknown solid red
coloured dog.  It was a clearly identifiable type in the 18th century.  The
Irish Red Setter Club was established in 1882 to promote the Breed.
The club issued the Breed Standard in 1886, and has organised field
trials and shows to set the Standard for the Breed since that time.  In
1998 the club published the working style for the breed.  The standard
and working style together describes the physical form and working
ability of the breed.
The Irish Red Setter has evolved down the years into a hardy, healthy,
intelligent dog, possessed of excellent working ability and great
stamina.
