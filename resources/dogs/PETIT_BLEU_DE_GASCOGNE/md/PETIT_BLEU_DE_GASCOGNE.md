### COAT


Hair: Short, semi-thick; dense (profuse).

Colour: Entirely mottled (black and white) giving a slate blue
colouring effect; marked or not with more or less extended black
patches.  Two black patches are generally placed at either side of the
head, covering the leathers, surrounding the eyes and stopping at the
cheeks.  They do not meet up on the top of the skull; they leave a
white interval in the middle of which is frequently found a small
black oval shaped spot, typical of the breed.  Two, more or less
bright tan markings are placed above the superciliary arches giving
the eyes a “quatreoeuillé” effect.  There are also traces of tan on the
cheeks, the lips, the inner face of the leathers, on the legs and under
the tail.

### SIZE:


Height at withers: Males:
52 to 58 cm.

Females: 50 to 56 cm.


FAULTS: Any departure from the foregoing points should be
considered a fault and the seriousness with which the fault should be
regarded should be in exact proportion to its degree and its effect
upon the health and welfare of the dog.
