BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: Hunting with scent hounds
was refered to in Polish literature as early as the XIIIth century.
Poland has always been a country covered by deep forests, full of big
game where the scent hound was the precious auxiliary of the hunter.
Hunting with scent hounds was highly esteemed by Polish nobility as
attested by XIVth century chronicles.
In the XVIIth century, at least two different types of Polish scent
hounds were already well distinguished.
Detailed descriptions are found in XIX th century hunting literature:
in 1819 Jan Szytier (Poradnik Mysliwych) describes the Polish
“brach” and the Polish scent hound; in 1821, in the magazine
“Sylwan”, W.Kozlowski gives a description and provides
illustrations of both types, the Polish “brach” (heavier) and the Polish
scent hound (lighter); the very detailed description of Ignacy
Bogatynski (1823- 1825, Nauka Lowiectwa) could be used as the
first breed standard.
After the first World War, the Polish scent hound was still used for
hunting in Poland; in the eastern regions but especially in the
mountains on particularly difficult terrains.



FCI-St. N° 354 / 23.11.2017
In the Podkarpacle region, the famous Polish cynologist, Jozef
Pawuslewicz (1903 – 1979) hunted with Polish scent hounds; he was
engaged in the development of breeding this dog.
He wrote the first Breed Standard and it is thanks to him that these
dogs were officially registered by the Polish Cynological
Association.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: A lithe dog of compact construction.
The bone structure is strong but not heavy.  The build implies a great
aptitude for mobility and an obvious disposition to resist difficult
working conditions in mountainous regions.

IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS: Medium sized.  Rectangular
build 9:10.

BEHAVIOUR / TEMPERAMENT: Stable and gentle.  This dog is
truly courageous and can even demonstrate proof of bravery.  He is
intelligent and easy to educate.  Not aggressive but remaining wary
towards strangers.  To his qualities as a hunting dog, must be added
those of an excellent guardian.  During the hunt he gives voice with a
characteristic melody in various intonations; a higher pitch for the
females.

HEAD: Noble, in proportion with the body.

### CRANIAL REGION:

marked but not prominent.
