Terriers.
With working trial.

BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: After the first World War a
group of active hunters separated from the numerically strong
Fox-Terrier Club. It was their aim to create a breed, the sole purpose
of which would be hunting performance. The experienced hunters
and cynologists Rudolf Frieß, Walter Zangenberg and Carl-Erich
Grünewald decided to select a black and tan hunting dog in particular
suitable for the hunt under the ground.  A coincidence came in
support of their efforts. A zoo director, Lutz Heck / Hagenberg
presented Walter Zangenberg with four black and tan terriers which
were said to come from pure-bred Fox-Terrier lines.  These dogs
became the foundation stock of the German Hunting Terrier. At the
time Dr Herbert Lackner joined the founders. After many years of
intensive breeding efforts, and through skilful crossings with the Old
English Wirehaired Terrier as well as with the Welsh Terrier, they
succeeded to fix the appearance of their breed.  At the same time
they put great emphasis on breeding a multitalented, well trainable,
hard, tongue-giving and water-happy dog with an explicit hunting
instinct.

### The


German
Hunting
Terrier
Club
(Deutscher
Jagdterrier-Club e.V.) was founded in 1926. As ever, the breeders
continued to value most carefully their breed for its usefulness as a
hunting dog, its steadiness of character, its courage and drive.
