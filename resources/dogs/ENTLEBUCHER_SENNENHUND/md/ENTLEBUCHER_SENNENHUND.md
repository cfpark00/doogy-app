SHORT HISTORICAL SURVEY: The “Entlebucher” is the
smallest of the four Swiss Mountain and Cattle Dogs.  He originates
from Entlebuch, a valley in the region of the Cantons Lucerne and
Bern.  The first description under the name “Entlibucherhund” dates
from the year 1889, but for a considerable time after that date, no
difference was made between Appenzell and Entlebuch Cattle Dogs.
In the year 1913 four examples of this small herding dog with
congenital bobtail were exhibited at the dog show in Langenthal and
presented to Prof.Dr.Albert Heim, the great patron of the Swiss
Mountain and Cattle Dog breeds.  On account of the judges reports,
they were entered into the Swiss Canine Stud Book (SHSB) as the
fourth Mountain and Cattle Dog breed.  However, the first standard
was only completed in 1927.  After August 28th 1926, the date of the
foundation of the Swiss Club of Entlebuch Cattle Dogs initiated by
Dr. B. Kobler, this breed was promoted and continued as purebred.
As the small number of entries into the SHSB (Swiss Stud Book)
shows, the breed developed only slowly.



FCI-St. N° 47  / 28.06.2002
The Entlebuch Cattle Dog received renewed impetus when, apart
from his hereditary qualities as a lively, tireless driving dog, his
outstanding suitability as a utility and companion dog was proved.
Today, still on a modest scale, this attractive tricoloured dog has
found his admirers and enjoys increased popularity as a family dog.
