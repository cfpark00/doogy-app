BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: Cocker Spaniels were
recognized as a separate breed from Field and Springer Spaniels
soon after the formation of the Kennel Club in 1873. He
originated as the ‘cocking spaniel’, and derived this name from
flushing woodcock. As with a number of gundog breeds there is
nowadays a difference between those used for work and those
used for show: the show Cocker is a sturdier, heavier version of
his working counterpart.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: Merry, sturdy, sporting; well
balanced; compact.

IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS: Measuring approximately the
same from withers to ground as from withers to root of tail.

BEHAVIOUR / TEMPERAMENT: Merry nature with everwagging tail shows a typical bustling movement, particularly when
following scent, fearless of heavy cover. Gentle and affectionate, yet
full of life and exuberance.

### HEAD

coarse.

but in the case of liver, liver roan and liver and white, dark hazel to
