UTILISATION: Originally a sheep dog, today a working dog
(guarding, defence, tracking, etc.) and an all-purpose service dog, as
well as a family dog.

FCI-CLASSIFICATION:  Group  1  Sheepdogs and Cattle Dogs


(except Swiss Cattle dogs).
Section 1 Sheepdogs.
With working trial.

BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: In Belgium, at the end of the
1800s, there were a great many herding dogs, whose type was varied
and whose coats were extremely dissimilar. In order to rationalise
this state of affairs, some enthusiastic dog fanciers formed a group
and sought guidance from Prof. A. Reul of the Cureghem Veterinary
Medical School, whom one must consider to have been the real
pioneer and founder of the breed.
The breed was officially born between 1891 and 1897. On
September 29th, 1891, the Belgian Shepherd Dog Club (Club du
Chien de Berger Belge) was founded in Brussels and in the same
year on November 15th in Cureghem, Professor A. Reul organised a
gathering of 117 dogs, which allowed him to carry out a return and
choose the best specimens. In the following years they began a real
programme of selection, carrying out some very close interbreeding
involving a few stud dogs.
By April 3rd, 1892, a first detailed breed standard had already been
drawn up by the Belgian Shepherd Dog Club. One single breed was
allowed, with three coat varieties. However, as was said at the time,
the Belgian Shepherd only belonged to ordinary people and therefore
the breed still lacked status.


St-FCI n°15/ 19.04.2002
As a result, it wasn’t until 1901 that the first Belgian Shepherds were
registered with the Royal Saint-Hubert Society Stud Book


### (L.O.S.H.).


During the following years, the prime movers among the Belgian
Shepherd enthusiasts set to work with great determination to unify
the type and correct the faults. It can be said that by 1910 the type
and temperament of the Belgian Shepherd had been established.
During the history of the Belgian Shepherd, the question of differing
but acceptable varieties and colours had led to many heated


discussions. On the other hand, anything involving morphology,
temperament and suitability for work has never caused any
disagreement.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: The Belgian Shepherd is a
mediolineal dog, harmoniously proportioned, combining elegance
and power, of medium size, with dry, strong muscle, fitting into a
square, rustic, used to the open air life and built to resist the frequent
atmospheric variations of the Belgian climate.
Through the harmony of its shape and its high head-carriage, the
Belgian Shepherd should give the impression of that elegant strength
which has become the heritage of the selected representatives of a
working breed. The Belgian Shepherd is to be judged in its natural
stance, without physical contact with the handler.

IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS: The Belgian Shepherd dog can
be fitted into a square. The chest is let down to the level of the
elbows. The length of the muzzle is equal to or slightly longer than
half the length of the head.

BEHAVIOUR / TEMPERAMENT: The Belgian Shepherd is a
watchful and active dog, bursting with energy, and always ready to
leap into action. As well as its innate skill at guarding flocks, it also
possesses the highly prized qualities of the best guard dog of
property. Without any hesitation it is the stubborn and keen protector
of its owner. It brings together all those qualities necessary for a
shepherd, guard, defence and service dog.


St-FCI n°15/ 19.04.2002
Its lively, alert temperament and its confident nature, showing no
fear or aggressiveness, should be obvious in its body stance and the
proud attentive expression in its sparkling eyes.
When judging this breed, one should take into consideration its calm
and fearless temperament.

HEAD: Carried high, long without exaggeration, rectilinear, well
chiselled and dry. Skull and muzzle are roughly equal in length, with
at the most a very slight bias in favour of the muzzle which puts the
finishing touch to the whole head.

CRANIAL REGION: Of medium width, in proportion with the
length of the head, with a forehead flat rather than round, frontal
groove not very pronounced; in profile, parallel to imaginary line
extending muzzle line; occipital crest little developed; brow ridges
and zygomatic arches not prominent.
Stop: Moderate.

### FACIAL REGION:


Nose: Black.
Muzzle: Medium length and well chiselled under the eyes; narrowing
gradually toward the nose, like an elongated wedge; bridge of the
nose straight and parallel to the continuation of the topline of the
forehead; mouth well split, which means that when the mouth is open
the commissures of the lips are pulled right back, the jaws being well
apart.
Lips: Thin, tight and strongly pigmented.
Jaws/teeth: Strong, white teeth, regularly and strongly set in welldeveloped jaws. Scissor bite; pincer bite, which is preferred by sheep
and livestock herders, is tolerated. Complete dentition according to
the dental formula; the absence of two premolars 1 (2 P1) is tolerated
and the molars 3 (M3) are not taken into consideration.
Cheeks: dry and quite flat, although muscled.

EYES: Medium size, neither protruding nor sunken, slightly almondshaped, obliquely set, brownish colour, preferably dark; black
rimmed eyelids; direct, lively, intelligent and enquiring look.


St-FCI n°15/ 19.04.2002
EARS: Rather small, set high, distinctly triangular appearance, wellrounded outer ear, pointed tips, stiff, carried upright and vertical
when dog is alert.

NECK: Well standing out, slightly elongated, rather upright, wellmuscled, broadening gradually towards the shoulders, without
dewlap, nape slightly arched.

BODY: Powerful without being heavy; length from point of shoulder
to point of buttock approximately equal to height at withers.
Topline: upper line of back and loins is straight.
Withers: Pronounced.
Back: firm, short and well-muscled.
Loins: Solid, short, sufficiently broad, well-muscled.
Croup: well-muscled; only very slightly sloping; sufficiently broad
but not excessively so.
Chest: little broad, but well let down; upper part of ribs arched; seen
from the front forechest little broad, but without being narrow.
Underline: Begins below the chest and rises gently in a harmonious
curve towards the belly, which is neither drooping nor tucked up, but
slightly raised and moderately developed.

TAIL: Well set on, strong at the base, of medium length, reaching at
least to hock, but preferably further; at rest carried down, with tip
curved backwards at level of hock; more raised when moving,
although without passing the horizontal, the curve towards the tip
becoming more accentuated, without ever at any time forming a
hook or deviation.

### LIMBS



### FOREQUARTERS:


General view: Bone solid but not heavy; muscle dry and strong; front
legs upright from all sides and perfectly parallel when seen from the
front.


St-FCI n°15/ 19.04.2002
Shoulder: Shoulder blade long and oblique, well attached, forming a
sufficient angle with the humerus, ideally measuring 110-115
degrees.
Upper arm: Long and sufficiently oblique.
Elbow: Firm, neither turning out nor tied in.
Forearm: Long and straight.
Wrist (carpus): very firm and clean.
Front pastern (metacarpus): Strong and short, as perpendicular to the
ground as possible or only very slightly sloping forward.
Forefeet: Round, cat feet; toes arched and well closed; pads thick and
springy; nails dark and strong.

### HINDQUARTERS:


General view: Powerful, but not heavy; in profile hindlegs are
upright and seen from behind perfectly parallel.
Upper thigh: Medium length, broad and strongly muscled.
Stifle: approximately on the plumb line from the hip; normal stifle
angulation.
Lower thigh: Medium length, broad and muscled.
Hock: Close to the ground, broad and muscled, moderate angulation.
Back pastern (metatarsus): Solid and short; dewclaws not desirable.
Hind feet: may be light oval; toes arched and well closed; pads thick
and springy; nails dark and strong.

GAIT / MOVEMENT: Lively and free movement at all gaits; the
Belgian Shepherd is a good galloper but its normal gaits are the walk
and especially the trot; limbs move parallel to the median plane of
the body. At high speed the feet come nearer to the median plane; at
the trot the reach is
medium, the movement even and easy, with good rear drive, and the
topline remains tight while the front legs are not lifted too high.
Always on the move, the Belgian Shepherd seems tireless; its gait is
fast, springy and lively. It is capable of suddenly changing direction
at full speed. Due to its exuberant character and its desire to guard
and protect, it has a definite tendency to move in circles.

SKIN: Elastic but taut over all the body; edges of lips and eyelids
strongly pigmented.


St-FCI n°15/ 19.04.2002

COATS AND VARIETIES: Since the coat varies in length,
direction, appearance and colour among Belgian Shepherds, this
particular point has been adopted as the criterion for distinguishing
between the four varieties of the breed: the Groenendael, the
Tervueren, the Malinois and the Laekenois.
These four varieties are judged separately and can each be awarded a
CAC, a CACIB or a reserve title.

Hair: In all the varieties the hair must always be dense, close-fitting
and of good texture, with the woolly undercoat forming an excellent
protective covering.

A. LONG HAIR: The hair is short on the head, the outer side of
the ears and the lower part of the legs, except on the rear side
of the forearm which is covered from elbow to wrist by long
hairs called fringes. The hair is long and smooth on the rest
of the body and longer and more abundant around the neck
and on the forechest, where it forms a collarette or ruff and a
jabot or apron. The opening of the ear is protected by thick
tufts of hair. From the base of the ear the hair is upright and
frames the head. The back of the thighs is covered with very
long abundant hair forming the culottes or breeches. The tail
is furnished with long, abundant hair forming a plume.
The Groenendael and the Tervueren are the long-haired.

B. SHORT HAIR: The hair is very short on the head, the outer
sides of the ears and the lower part of the legs. It is short
over the rest of the body and fuller at the tail and around the
neck where it forms a collarette or ruff which begins at the
base of the ear, stretching as far as the throat. As well, the
back of the thighs is fringed with longer hair. The tail is ear
of corn shaped, but does not form a plume.
The Malinois is the short-haired.




St-FCI n°15/ 19.04.2002
C. ROUGH HAIR: What especially characterises the rough hair
variety is the roughness and dryness of the hair, which,
moreover, is rasping and tousled. About 6 cm long over the
whole body, the hair is shorter on the top of the muzzle, the
forehead and the legs. The hair around the eyes and those
furnishing the muzzle should not be so long as to disguise
the shape of the head. However, it is essential to have
furnishings on the muzzle. The tail should not form a plume.
The Laekenois is the rough-haired.

Colour:
Mask: For Tervueren and Malinois the mask must be very
pronounced and tend to encompass the top and bottom lip, the
corners of the lips and the eyelids in one single black zone. A strict
minimum of six points of skin pigmentation is called for: the two
ears, the two upper eyelids and the two lips, upper and lower, which
must be black.
Black overlay: In Tervueren and Malinois, the black overlay means
that the hairs have a black tip which shades the base colour. This
blackening is in any case “flamed” and must not be present in great
patches nor in real stripes (brindled). In the Laekenois the black
shading is more discreetly expressed.

Groenendael: Only uniform black.

Tervueren: Only fawn with black overlay or grey with black overlay,
with black mask; however, the fawn with black overlay is still
preferred. The fawn must be rich, neither light nor washed-out. Any
dog whose coat colour is anything but fawn with black overlay or
does not match the desired intensity of colour cannot be considered
an elite specimen.

Malinois: Only fawn with black overlay and with black mask.

Laekenois: Only fawn with traces of black overlay, mainly on the
muzzle and the tail.



St-FCI n°15/ 19.04.2002
For all varieties: a small amount of white is tolerated on forechest
and toes.
