BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: The Welsh Terrier is a breed
with a truly working background, he is perhaps rather less exuberant
than some of the other members of his group. Like so many of his
cousins, he was originally used in hunting the fox, badger and even
otter. The Welsh and Lakeland Terriers, which have considerable
similarity, may well have had a common origin prior to the Roman
invasion of Britain when their Celtic owners retreated to the Welsh
mountains and the Lake District.
He is a neat, workmanlike dog with a tight wiry coat normally of
black and tan.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: Smart, workmanlike, well-balanced
and compact.

BEHAVIOUR AND TEMPERAMENT: Affectionate, obedient
and easily controlled. Happy and volatile, rarely of shy nature. Game
and fearless but definitely not aggressive although at all times able to
hold his own when necessary
