A BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: The breeding of this
breed in the north German Münsterland has been documented
since around 1870. The blood of hundreds of years of old
flushing and pointing dogs flowed in the Kleiner Münsterländer.
In 1912, the "Association for Kleine Münsterländer Poining
Dogs (Heidewachtelhunde)" was founded in the parent country
Germany to preserve and promote these dogs as an independent
hunting breed. Hunters were to be provided with a mediumsized, passionate, intelligent and affectionate, fully versatile
hunting dog in the field, forest and water. In 1921, Dr. Dr.
Friedrich Jungklaus created the first breed standard, which has
been regularly enhanced since then. Today, the Kleiner
Münsterländer is a versatile hunting dog that is very popular
with hunters worldwide because of its performance capabilities.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: Strong and harmonious build of
medium size, showing balanced proportions with a lot of quality and
elegance. Distinguished head. In upright posture the dog displays
flowing outlines with horizontally carried tail. Its front legs are well
feathered, the hind legs with breeches, the tail has a distinct flag.
Its glossy coat should be straight or slightly wavy, dense and not too
long. Its movement is harmonious and far reaching.


FCI-St. N° 102 / 14.11.2019
The overall appearance of the breed must always show its utility
as a hunting dog.

### IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS:


The length of the body, measured from the prosternum to the point
of the buttock, should exceed the height at the withers. The goal is a
ratio 1 to 1.1.
The length of the skull from the occiput to the stop is equal to the
length of the muzzle from the stop to the nose. The distance from
the ground to the elbows should be approximately equal to the
distance from the elbows to the withers.


BEHAVIOUR / TEMPERAMENT: The Kleiner Münsterländer
is intelligent and capable of learning, full of temperament but even,
with steady character; its attitude towards people is alert and friendly
(suitable for family life), with good social behaviour and keeps close
contact with his master (team spirit); with passionate, persevering
predatory instinct, versatile hunting aptitudes and strong nerves and
keenness for game.
The dog must have the natural abilities required to hunt in close
cooperation with its handler in the field, forest and water
(versability), and to retrieve game to the hunter.

with a long flag and white tip, abundant coat on the fore chest is
undesirable.

mantle or brown ticking; blaze permitted. Tan coloured markings on

a fault and the seriousness with which the fault should be regarded
should be in exact proportion to its degree and its effect upon the
health and welfare of the dog.
