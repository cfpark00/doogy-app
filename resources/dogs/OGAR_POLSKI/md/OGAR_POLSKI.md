UTILIZATION: Scent Hound. In the past, the Polish Hounds were
used mainly for hunting hares, foxes, roe deer, wild boar and during
duck hunting, flushing wild ducks from rushes. Nowadays, since
hunting hare with dogs is prohibited in Poland (except for mountain
areas), Polish Hounds are used only for hunting wild boar and fox
throughout the country.

FCI-CLASSIFICATION: Group


## 6   Scent hounds and related



breeds.

Section 1.1  Large sized Hounds.

With working trial.

BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: The Ogar is an oldestablished Polish breed. The first reports on hunting with dogs in
Poland are found in the ‘Chronicles’ of Gallus Anonymous dating
from the 11th century. In chronicles of the 14th century it is
mentioned that ogar hounds were bred specifically for the royal hunt.
The name ogar is found in the Book on Rural Arts by Piotr
Krescentyn published in Cracow in 1549 and in The Life of an
Honest Man by Mikołaj Rej from 1568. In 1618, the Cracovian
publishing house issued Hunting with Ogar hounds by count Jan
Ostroróg, the voivode of Poznań. This work may be considered the
first Polish cynological guide, containing the principles of rational
breeding. The first description of the Polish (Ogar) Hound is found in
the book: ‘The beginnings of the natural history and farming of the
national domestic and wild animals’ by Krzysztof Kluk (1779). In
the 19th century, many Polish as well as German and Russian
publications appeared, describing Polish Hounds in detail.


FCI-St. N° 52 / 27.05.2015
The etymology of the word Ogar is not clear. Different authors claim
different origins of the word. According to Sztolcman and GeraldWyżycki, Ogar originated from the Polish word ‘ogorzały’ (‘tawny’),
describing the Polish Hound’s colour. In Mann’s opinion, it might
have derived from the word ‘grać’ ‘to give tongue’ which defines the
characteristic barking on the trail; while Frankiewicz explained it
with Czech word ‘ohař’, meaning ‘the pointing dog’. Polish Hounds
were very popular and they have found their rightful place in the
literature. They can be found on engravings: ancestral and urban
emblems, coats of arms, seals, ex-librises and in the paintings of 18th
and19thcentury as well. Polish Hounds were exhibited at dog shows
already in the 19th century. Poland was under occupation at that time
and the Polish Hounds were bred in kennels of Polish nobility on the
territory annexed by Russia. Poland regained its independence after
123 years of occupation, after the Great War in 1918. The hunting
with hounds outlasted only in residual forms in the territory of Easter
Borderlands, i.e. in the regions of Polesie, Wołyń and Vilnius. After
the World War II, Poland had lost the Easter Borderlands together
with the mainstay of Polish Scent Hounds. There were practically no
Polish Hounds bred within the new borders of the country. In 1959,
colonel Piotr Kartawik imported the first four Polish Hounds from
his homeland (nowadays Belarus territory) and established the first
Polish Hound kennel in the post-war history with the kennel name ‘z
Kresów’ (‘from the Borderlands’). In 1964, on the basis of the
Kartawik’s ‘z Kresów’ dogs, engineer Jerzy Dylewski wrote the first
standard of the Polish Hound breed that was included in the FCI
register on 15 November 1966 under the number 52.

BEHAVIOUR/TEMPERAMENT: The Polish Hound, like all scent
hounds, chase the game on the hot trail, with loud barking. The voice
is lower pitched in the male and higher in the female. The barking is
called “giving tongue” by hunters, and the loud game pursuit by the
dogs is described as “the chase”. This outstanding hunting dog is also
an excellent family dog, easy to maintain, devoted to the household
and wary of strangers.

• Aggressive or overly shy dogs.
• Any dog clearly showing physical or behavioural abnormalities.
• Untypical specimen.

### N.B.:


• Male animals should have two apparently normal testicles fully

• Only functionally and clinically healthy dogs, with breed typical

conformation, should be used for breeding.
