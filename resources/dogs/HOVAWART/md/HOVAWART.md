BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: The Hovawart is a very old
German working dog in its original sense. The name’s origin stems
from Middle High German (an old form of German); Hova = Hof (=
yard, farm, estate) and wart = Wächter (=guardian). Since 1922 he was
developed with the use of dogs similar in type which were still found
on farms, and through outcrossing with German Shepherd Dogs,
Newfoundlands and Leonbergers among others, as a breed. In 1937 he
was recognized as a breed and in 1964 as a working dog. Through
persistent selection for breeding, starting as early as the 1960s, on the
characteristic “free of hip dysplasia”, the diseases is almost entirely
forced back.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: The Hovawart is a powerful, mediumlarge size, slightly longer than the height at the withers, longhaired
working dog. The difference in sexes is above all clearly noticeable at
