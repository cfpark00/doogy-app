BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: In the USA and Canada
White Shepherd dogs have gradually become to be accepted as a
distinct breed. The first dogs of this breed were imported to
Switzerland in the early 70ies. The American male “Lobo”, whelped
on 5th of March 1966, can be considered as the progenitor of the
breed in Switzerland. The descendants of this male registered with
the Swiss Stud Book (LOS) and other White Shepherd dogs imported
from the USA and Canada, gradually multiplied. There now exists a
big number of pure-bred over several generations White Shepherd
dogs throughout Europe. These dogs have been registered as a new
breed in the appendix of the Swiss Stud Book (LOS) since June 1991
