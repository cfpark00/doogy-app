FCI-CLASSIFICATION:   Group  3    Terriers.
Section 1  Large and medium-sized
Terriers.

Without working trial.

BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY:  In the 19th and early 20th
centuries, many young Brazilians studied in the European universities,
especially in France and England.
These young people often returned married and their wives brought
with them a small Terrier type dog. The young Brazilians and their
families went back to the farms they had left. The little dog adapted to
farm life and crossed with local dogs and bitches. Thus, a new type
was formed and the phenotype was fixed in a few generations.
With the development of large cities, the great urban centres attracted
farmers, their families and employees. In this way the small dog
underwent another change of environment.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: Medium-sized dog, slender, well
balanced, with firm but not very heavy structure, square shaped body
with curved lines.

IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS: Square dog: the length of its body,
measured from the shoulder to the tip of the iliac is approximately the
same as the height at the withers.
