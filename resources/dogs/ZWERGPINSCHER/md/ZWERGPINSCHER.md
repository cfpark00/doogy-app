### MINIATURE PINSCHER


(Zwergpinscher)




FCI-St. N° 185 / 18.04.2007
TRANSLATION:  Mrs C. Seidler.  Official language (DE).

COUNTRY OF ORIGIN: Germany.

### DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THE OFFICIAL VALID



### STANDARD: 06.03.07.



UTILISATION: House and Companion Dog.

FCI-CLASSIFICATION: Group 2
Pinscher and Schnauzer-
Molossian breeds - Swiss
Mountain and Cattle Dogs.



Section  1  Pinscher and Schnauzer
type.

Without working trial.

BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY:  Miniature Pinschers were
kept in large numbers around the turn of the century already and the
Stud Book for 1925 records no less than 1300 entries. Like with the
German Pinscher, from the numerous colour variations, only the
colours black with lighter markings and solid red to red-brown were
thorough-bred.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: The Miniature Pinscher is a reduced
image of the German Pinscher without the draw-backs of a dwarfed
appearance. His elegant square build is clearly visible due to his
short smooth coat.

### IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS:


•
The ratio from length to height shall make his build appear as
square as possible.
•
The length of the head (measured from the tip of the nose to the
occiput) corresponds to half the length of the topline (measured
from the withers to the set on of the tail).



FCI-St. N° 185 / 18.04.2007
BEHAVIOUR/TEMPERAMENT: Lively, spirited, self assured
and evenly tempered. These qualities make him an agreeable family
and companion dog.

### HEAD



### CRANIAL REGION


Skull: Strong, elongated without markedly protruding occiput. The
forehead is flat without wrinkles, running parallel to the bridge of
nose.
Stop: Slight, yet clearly defined.

### FACIAL REGION



Nose: Noseleather well developed and black.
Muzzle: Ending in a blunt wedge. Bridge of nose straight.
Lips: Black, smooth and tight-fitting to the jaw. Corners of lips
closed.
Jaws/Teeth: Strong upper and lower jaw.  The complete scissor bite
(42 pure white teeth according to the dentition formula), is strong
and firmly closing.  The chewing muscles are strongly developed
without pronounced cheeks interfering with the smooth outline.

EYES: Dark, oval, with black pigmented close fitting eyelids.

EARS: Prick ears; drop ears, set high, V-shaped with the inner edges
lying close to the cheeks, turned forward towards temples.  Folds
parallel, should not be above the top of the skull.

NECK: Nobly curved, not too short. Blending smoothly into the
withers without any marked set on. Dry without dewlap or
throatiness. Throat skin tight-fitting without folds.

### BODY


Topline: Slightly sloping from withers towards rear.
Withers: Forming the highest point in topline.
Back: Strong, short and taut.
Loins: Strong. The distance from last rib to hip is short to make the
dog appear compact.


FCI-St. N° 185 / 18.04.2007
Croup: Slightly rounded, imperceptibly blending into tail set on.
Chest: Moderately broad, oval in diameter, reaching to elbows. The
forechest is distinctly marked by the point of the sternum.
Underline and belly: Flanks not too tucked up, forming a nicely
curved line with the underside of the brisket.

TAIL: Natural; a sabre or sickle carriage is sought after.

### LIMBS



### FOREQUARTERS:


General appearance: Seen from the front, the front legs are strong,
straight and not close together.  Seen from the side, the forearms are
straight.
Shoulders:  The shoulder blade lies close against the ribcage and is
well muscled on both sides of the shoulder bone, protruding over the
points of the thoracic vertebrae. As sloping as possible and well laid
back, forming an angle of appr. 50° to the horizontal.
Upper arm: Lying close to the body, strong and well muscled,
forming an angle of 95° to 100° to the shoulder blade.
Elbows: Correctly fitting, turning neither in nor out.
Forearm: Strongly developed and well muscled. Completely straight
seen from the front and the side.
Carpal joint: Strong and firm.
Pastern: Strong and springy. Seen from the front, vertical, seen from
the side, slightly sloping towards the ground.
Forefeet:  Short and round, toes well-knit and arched (cat feet), pads
resistant, nails short, black and strong.

### HINDQUARTERS:


General appearance: Standing obliquely, when seen from the side,
standing parallel but not close together seen from the rear.
Upper thigh: Moderately long, broad, strongly muscled.
Stifle: Turning neither in nor out.

FCI-St. N° 185 / 18.04.2007
Hind feet: Somewhat longer than forefeet. Toes well-knit and arched.
Nails short and black.

GAIT/MOVEMENT: The Miniature Pinscher is a trotter. His back
remains firm and rather steady in movement. The movement is
harmonious, sure, powerful, and uninhibited with good length of
stride. Typical of the trot is a ground covering, relaxed, fluent
movement with strong drive and free front extension.

SKIN: Tight fitting over the whole body.

### COAT



Hair: Short and dense, smooth, close and shiny without bald patches.

Colour:
•
Self coloured: Deer red, reddish-brown to dark red brown.
•
Black and Tan: Lacquer black with red or brown markings.
The aim is for markings as dark, as rich, and as clearly defined as
possible. The markings are distributed as follows: Above the
eyes, at the underside of the throat, on the pasterns, on the feet, at
the inside of the hind legs and under the root of the tail. Two
even, clearly separated triangles on the chest.
