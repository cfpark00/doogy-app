Section  1 Retrievers

With working trial.

BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: It is popularly thought that
the Labrador Retriever originated on the coast of Newfoundland
where fishermen were seen to use a dog of similar appearance to
retrieve fish. An excellent water dog, his weather-resistant coat and
unique tail, likened to that of an otter because of its shape,
emphasise this trait.
Comparatively speaking, the Labrador is not a very old breed, its
breed club having been formed in 1916 and the Yellow Labrador
Club having been founded in 1925. It was in field trialling that the
Labrador found early fame, having been originally introduced to
these shores in the late 1800s by Col Peter Hawker and the Earl of
Malmesbury. It was a dog called Malmesbury Tramp which was
described by Lorna, Countess Howe as one of the ‘tap roots’ of the
modern Labrador.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: Strongly built, short-coupled, very
active; (which precludes excessive body weight or substance) broad
in skull; broad and deep through chest and ribs; broad and strong
over loins and hindquarters.

BEHAVIOUR AND TEMPERAMENT: Good-tempered, very
agile. Excellent nose, soft mouth; keen lover of water. Adaptable,
devoted companion.
Intelligent, keen and biddable, with a strong will to please. Kindly
nature, with no trace of aggression or undue shyness.
