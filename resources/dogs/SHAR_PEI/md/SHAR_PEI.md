BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: This Chinese breed has
existed for hundreds of years in the provinces bordering the South
China Sea.  The town of Dialak in the province of Kwun Tung is
probably the place of origin.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: Active, compact, short coupled and
squarely built dog of medium size.  Wrinkles over skull and withers,
small ears and « hippopotamus » muzzle impart to the Shar Pei a
unique look.  Dogs larger and more powerful than bitches.

IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS: The height of the Shar Pei from
withers to ground is approximately equal to the length of the body,
from point of shoulder to point of buttock, especially in males.  The
length from nose to stop is approximately equal to the length from
stop to occiput.

BEHAVIOUR / TEMPERAMENT: Calm, independent, loyal,
affectionate to his family.

### HEAD


Rather large in proportion to body.  Wrinkles on forehead and cheeks
continuing to form dewlap.

Stop: Moderate.

### FACIAL REGION:


Nose: Large and wide, preferably black, but any colour conforming
to general coat colour permissible.  Wide opened nostrils.
Muzzle: A distinctive feature of the breed.  Broad from root to tip of
nose with no suggestion of tapering.  Lips and top of muzzle well
padded.  Bulge at the base of the nose permissible.
Mouth: Tongue, roof of mouth, gums and flews : bluish black is
preferred.  Pink spotted tongue permissible.  Solid pink tongue
highly undesirable.  In dilute-coloured dogs the tongue is solid
lavender.
Jaws/Teeth: Jaws strong with a perfect scissor bite, i.e. the upper
teeth closely overlapping the lower teeth and set square to the jaws.
Padding of lower lip should not be so excessive as to interfere with
the bite.

EYES: Dark, almond-shaped with a scowling expression.  Lighter
colour permissible in dilute-coloured dogs.  Function of eyeball or
lid in no way disturbed by surrounding skin, folds or hair.  Any sign
of irritation of eyeball, conjunctiva or eyelids highly undesirable.
Free from entropion.

EARS: Very small, rather thick, equilaterally triangular in shape,
slightly rounded at tip and set high on the skull with tips pointing
towards eyes; set well forward over eyes, wide apart and close to
skull.  Pricked ears highly undesirable.

NECK: Medium length, strong, set well on shoulders.  The loose
skin under the neck should not be excessive.

BODY: Folds of skin on body in mature dogs highly undesirable
except on withers and base of tail, which show moderate wrinkling.
Topline: Dips slightly behind withers; then it rises slightly over loin.
Back: Short, strong.


FCI-St. N° 309 / 09.08.1999

### COAT



Hair: A distinctive feature of the breed: short, harsh and bristly.  The
coat is straight and offstanding on the body, but generally flatter on
the limbs.  No undercoat.  The coat may vary in length from 1 cm to
2,5 cm.  Never trimmed.

Colour: All solid colours acceptable except white.  Tail and rear part
of thighs frequently of a lighter colour.  Darker shading down the
back and on the ears permissible.

### SIZE:


Height: 44 - 51 cm at withers (17,5 - 20 ins).

FAULTS: Any departure from the foregoing points should be
considered a fault and the seriousness with which the fault should be
regarded should be in exact proportion to its degree and its effect
upon the health and welfare of the dog.

### SERIOUS FAULTS:


• Deviation from a scissor bite (as a transitory measure, a very
slightly overshot mouth is permissible).
• Snipy muzzle.
• Spotted tongue (except pink spotted tongue).
• Large ears.
• Low set tail.
• Coat longer than 2,5 cm.

### ELIMINATING FAULTS:


• Aggressive or overly shy.
• Any dog clearly showing physical or behavioural abnormalities.
• Flat foreface with badly overshot bite; undershot bite.
• Solid pink tongue.
• Lower lip rolled in, interfering with the bite.
• Round, bulging eye.  Entropion, ectropion.
• Skin, folds or hair disturbing the normal function of the eye.
• Pricked ears.


FCI-St. N° 309 / 09.08.1999
• Absence of tail; stumpy tail.
• Heavy folds of skin on body (except withers and base of tail) and
limbs.
• Not a solid colour (albino, brindle, patches, spots, black and tan,
saddled pattern).

### N.B.:


• Male animals should have two apparently normal testicles fully

descended into the scrotum.
• Only functionally and clinically healthy dogs, with breed typical
conformation should be used for breeding.


REMARK: Any artificial physical alteration to the Shar Pei (in
particular lips and eyelids) eliminates the dog from competition.
