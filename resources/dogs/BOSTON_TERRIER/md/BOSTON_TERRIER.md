FCI-St. N° 140 / 24.06.2014

### DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THE OFFICIAL VALID



### STANDARD: 28.01.2013



UTILIZATION: Companion.

### FCI-CLASSIFICATION:


Group 9
Companion and Toy



Dogs.

Section 11 Small Molossian Dogs.

Without working trial.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: The Boston Terrier is a lively, highly
intelligent, smooth coated, short-headed, compactly built, shorttailed, well balanced dog, brindle, seal or black in colour and evenly
marked with white.  The head is in proportion to the size of the dog
and the expression indicates a high degree of intelligence.  The body
is rather short and well knit, the limbs strong and neatly turned, the
tail is short and no feature is so prominent that the dog appears badly
proportioned.  The dog conveys an impression of determination,
strength and activity, with style of a high order; carriage easy and
graceful.  A proportionate combination of « Colour and White
Markings » is a particularly distinctive feature of a representative
specimen.
« Balance, Expression, Colour and White Markings » should be
given particular consideration in determining the relative value of
general appearance to other points.
The clean-cut short backed body of the Boston Terrier coupled with
the unique characteristics of his square head and jaw, and his striking
markings have resulted in a most dapper and charming American
original: The Boston Terrier.
In a comparison of specimens of each sex, the only evident
difference is a slight refinement in the bitch’s conformation.




FCI-St. N° 140 / 24.06.2014
IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS: The length of leg must balance
with the length of body to give the Boston Terrier its striking square
appearance.  The Boston Terrier is a sturdy dog and must not appear
to be either spindly or coarse.  The bone and muscle must be in
proportion as well as an enhancement to the dog’s weight and
structure.

BEHAVIOUR / TEMPERAMENT:  The Boston Terrier is a
friendly and lively dog.  The breed has an excellent disposition and a
high degree of intelligence, which makes the Boston Terrier an
incomparable companion.

### HEAD



### CRANIAL REGION:


Skull: Square, flat on top, free from wrinkles; brow abrupt.
Stop: Well defined.

### FACIAL REGION:


Nose: Black and wide, with a well defined line between the nostrils.
Well opened nostrils.
Muzzle: Short, square, wide and deep and in proportion to the skull.
It is free from wrinkles, shorter in length than in width or depth; not
exceeding in length approximately one-third of the length of the
skull.  The muzzle from stop to end of the nose is parallel to the top
of the skull.
Lips: The chops are of good depth, but not pendulous, completely
covering the teeth when the mouth is closed.
Jaws/Teeth: Jaws broad and square with short, regular teeth.  The
bite is even or sufficiently undershot to square the muzzle.
Cheeks: Flat.

EYES: Wide apart, large, round and dark in colour.  Set square in the
skull and the outside corners are on a line with the cheeks as viewed
from the front.
Expression: Alert and kind, indicating a high degree of intelligence.
This is a most important characteristic of the breed.


FCI-St. N° 140 / 24.06.2014
EARS: Small, carried erect, either natural or cropped to conform to
the shape of the head and situated as near to the corners of the skull
as possible.

NECK: The length of the neck must display an image of balance to
the total dog.  It is slightly arched, carrying the head gracefully and
setting neatly into the shoulders.

BODY: The body should appear short.
Top line: Level.
Back: Just short enough to square the body.
Croup: Curves slightly to the set-on of the tail.
Chest: Deep with good width; ribs well sprung and carried well back
to the loins.

TAIL:  Set-on low, short, fine and tapering, straight or screw and
must not be carried above the horizontal.  (Note : The preferred tail
does not exceed in length more than one quarter the distance from
set-on to hock).

### LIMBS



### FOREQUARTERS:


General appearance: Forelegs set moderately wide apart and on a line
with the upper tip of the shoulder-blades; straight in bone.
Shoulder: Sloping and well laid back, which allows for the Boston
Terrier’s stylish movement.
Elbow: Stand neither in nor out.
Pastern: Short, strong.  The dewclaws may be removed.
Forefeet: Small, round and compact, turned neither in nor out, with
well arched toes and short nails.

### HINDQUARTERS:


Thighs: Strong, well muscled, and set true.
Stifle (Knee): Well bent.
Hock: Short to the feet, turning neither in nor out, with a well
defined hock joint.



FCI-St. N° 140 / 24.06.2014

Hind feet: Small and compact with short nails.

GAIT / MOVEMENT: The gait of the Boston Terrier is that of a
sure footed, straight gaited dog, forelegs and hind legs moving
straight ahead in line with perfect rhythm, each step indicating grace
and power.

### COAT


Hair: Short, smooth, bright and fine in texture.

Colour: Brindle, seal or black with white markings.  Brindle is
preferred only if all other qualities are equal. (Note : Seal defined :
Seal appears black except it has a red cast when viewed in the sun or
bright light).
Required markings: White muzzle band, white blaze between the
eyes, white forechest.
Desired markings: White muzzle band, even white blaze between the
eyes and over the head, white collar, white forechest, white on part
or whole of forelegs and hind legs below the hocks. (Note: a
representative specimen should not be penalized for not possessing
« Desired Markings ».)
A dog with a preponderance of white on the head or body must
possess sufficient merit otherwise to counteract its deficiencies.

### WEIGHT:


Weight is divided by classes as follows:
• under 15 pounds (6,8 kg),
• 15 pounds and under 20 pounds (6,8 to 9 kg),
• 20 pounds and not to exceed 25 pounds (9 to 11,35 kg).
