TRANSLATION: Mrs. Peggy Davis.  Official language (ES).

ORIGIN: Spain.

### DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THE OFFICIAL VALID



### STANDARD: 26.05.1982.



UTILIZATION: Pointing dog for fur and feather; much
appreciated by the hunters who want a robust dog, resistant on any
terrain and for any type of hunting, obedient, strong and above all
endowed with a keen sense of smell.  His excellent skill and style of
hunting results from his calm and firmness in tracking as well as
from his impeccable pointing and retrieving.  Although usually used
on small game, he is not averse to the hunting of big game, a task
where he shows great courage.

### FCI-CLASSIFICATION:


Group 7
Pointing Dogs.

Section 1.1 Continental
Pointing



Dogs, type « Braque ».

With working trial.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: Hunting dog of good size, well
balanced and of medium proportions.  With a well developed head
and pendulous ears, a compact body and solid legs; short coat. Of
medium frame the length of the body should possibly be the same as
the height at the withers.  In stance and in movement balance in
proportions and functional harmony are desired.

BEHAVIOUR / TEMPERAMENT: Robust, balanced, calm and
sedate he is an excellent pointing dog, specializing in hunting
feathered and small game.  With his soft, very noble expression, it is
a breed with an excellent temperament, docility and intelligence.




FCI-St. N°90 / 09.11.1998


### HEAD



General appearance: Large and powerful with a well developed skull,
a strong foreface and muzzle, and hanging corkscrew ears.  The
cranial-facial ensemble seen from above must be moderately
rectangular with progressive diminution towards the nose, without
however giving an appearance of a pointed muzzle.  The relation
between the length of the skull and that of the muzzle is of 6 to 5.
The cranial-facial axes are divergent.

### CRANIAL REGION:


Skull: Broad, strong, rounded, convex in profile, with a well marked
median furrow and a slightly marked occipital crest.  Superciliary
arches pronounced.
Stop: Gentle slope, only slightly marked.

### FACIAL REGION:


Nose: Dark brown, wet, large and wide with open nostrils.
Muzzle: Straight in profile or very slightly convex towards the nose.
Broad in its entire length, must not give the impression of being
pointed.  Broad nasal bridge.
Lips: Hanging without being limp.  Upper lip should well cover the
lower lip.  The lower lip forms a well defined labial corner
(commissure).  The mucous membranes must be dark brown.
Jaws/Teeth: Teeth solid, white and sound.  Scissor bite.  All
premolars must be present.

EYES: Medium size, almond shaped; colour preferably dark hazel
with a noble and soft expression sometimes giving the impression of
sadness.  Eyelids medium thick, brown pigmented the same as the
mucous membranes.  The lower lid should be as close as possible to
the eyeball.

EARS: Leathers large and hanging, of triangular shape. Set at eye
level.  At rest, they hang gracefully in corkscrew.  Without being
drawn forward they must meet the corner of the lips but not the nose.


FCI-St. N°90 / 09.11.1998
Soft and limp to the touch, with fine skin and hair, distinct plexus of
veins.  When the dog is attentive, the ear set is higher and the line of
the set-on flatter.
Palate: With pink mucous membranes and well marked ridges.

NECK: Strong and powerful; broad at the beginning, widening
slightly towards the body.  Upper line slightly arched.  Underline
with a well defined double dewlap starting from both corners of the
lips, without being too much exaggerated.

### BODY:


General appearance: Square, strong and robust with powerful chest
and thorax, giving the impression of power and agility.

Topline: Straight, horizontal or preferably with a slight slope down
from the withers.  Never a sway back.  Without rocking or rolling
when on the move.
Back: Powerful and muscular.
Loin: Of medium length, broad and muscular, giving the impression
of power.
Croup: Broad and solid.  Its inclination in relation to the topline, or
also to the ground, should be inferior to 45°.  Height at the croup
equal or slightly less than the height at the withers.
Chest: Broad, deep, reaching elbow level, muscular and powerful.
Point of sternum quite prominent.  Ribs well developed, round, not
flat, rib spaces well marked and getting wider towards the floating
ribs.  The thoracic perimeter must be equal to the height at the
withers increased by a quarter of the height at the withers.
Underline and belly: Belly moderately tucked up towards the
genitals.  Flanks deep and well defined.

TAIL: Thick at the root, set at medium height.  Is docked to one
third or to the half of its length.

### LIMBS



### FOREQUARTERS:


General appearance: Limbs vertical, straight and parallel.  Solid bone
structure.  Short pasterns with well developed feet.
Shoulder: Moderately oblique, muscled.  The shoulder blade must
have about the same length as the upper arm.
Upper arm: Strong and well muscled.  Its length should be 2/3 of that
of the forearm.
Elbow: Close to the body
Forearm: Of strong bone structure with well defined tendons.
Straight, vertical.  Its length is double that of the total length from the
pastern joint (carpus) to the ground.
Pastern (Metacarpus): Very slightly oblique in profile, practically in
the prolongation of the forearm.  Solid bone structure.
Forefeet: Cat feet, strong tight toes, well knuckled-up.  Dark nails.
Pads hard, very broad and resistant.  Interdigital membrane
moderately developed.
Angulations: Scapular-humeral angle about 100°.
Humeral-radial angle      about 125°.

### HINDQUARTERS:


General appearance: Powerful and muscular, strong bone, with
vertical limbs and correct angles; well marked and bent hocks not
deviated, giving the impression of power and solidity.
Upper thigh: Very strong with a well developed, clearly defined,
visible musculature.  Its length is 3/4 of that of the lower thigh.
Lower thigh: Long, of strong bone structure with a length double
than that of the hock.
Hock joint: Well marked, with tendon clearly visible.
Hock: Strong bone, perpendicular to the ground.
Hind feet: Cat-feet, like those of the forelegs, though slightly longer.
Angulations: Coxal-femoral angle - about 100°.

Femoral-tibial angle - about 120°.

Angle at hockjoint blunter than 130°.




FCI-St. N°90 / 09.11.1998
GAIT / MOVEMENT: Typical gait of the breed is a steady
economical trot, flowing and powerful without tendency to lateral
rolling movement or to ambling.

SKIN: Elastic without being loose, thick, abundant, of pink colour
without patches.  All mucous membranes should be brown, never
black.

### COAT


Hair: Dense, of medium thickness, short, smooth and evenly
distributed all over the body down to the tissue between toes; finer
on the head, the leathers and the legs.

Colour: The basic colours of the coat are white and liver.  These
colours mix irregularly, giving a liver-marbled or greyish liver or
liver-speckled coat as well as other combinations, according to
whether the liver or the white is predominant and according to
whether the white patches are smaller or larger.  A very frequent
characteristic of the coat, although not necessary, is a distinct white
patch on the forehead; the leathers are always spotted in selfcoloured liver.  The liver coloured hairs may form distinct patches of
that colour, spread irregularly over the whole coat of the animal.  The
same applies to white hairs which may form patches of that colour in
the oat without, however, being very extended.  Never to be
admitted: black colour or tan markings above the eyes and on the
legs.

### SIZE:


Height at the withers: Males:  62-67 cm.



Bitches: 59-64 cm.


This breed shows a high degree of dimorphism, the males being
more homogenous and the females of more variable sizes and much
finer in general.

FAULTS : Any departure from the foregoing points should be
considered a fault and the seriousness with which the fault should be
regarded should be in exact proportion to its degree and its effect
upon the health and welfare of the dog.
