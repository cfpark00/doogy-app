GENERAL APPEARANCE: The American Water Spaniel is an
active muscular dog, medium in size with a marcel to curly coat.
Emphasis is placed on proper size and a symmetrical relationship of
parts, texture of coat and colour.
A solidly built and well-muscled dog full of strength and quality.
The breed has as much substance and bone as necessary to carry the
muscular structure but not so much as to appear clumsy.

IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS: Is slightly longer than tall, not
too square or compact.  However, exact proportion is not as
important as the dog being well-balanced and sound, capable of
performing the breed’s intended function.

/

Demeanor
indicates
intelligence, eagerness to please and friendly.  Great energy and
eagerness for the hunt yet controllable in the field.

FCI-St. N°301 / 22.01.1999
Stop: Moderately defined, but not too pronounced.

### FACIAL REGION:


Nose: Dark in colour, black or dark brown.  The nose sufficiently
wide and with well-developed nostrils to insure good scenting power.
Muzzle: Moderate in length, square with good depth.  No inclination
to snipiness.
Lips: Clean and tight without excess skin or flews.
Jaws/Teeth: Either scissor or level bite.

EYES: Medium size, set well apart, while slightly rounded, should
not appear protruding or bulging.  Lids tight, not drooping.  Eye
colour can range from a light yellowish brown to brown, hazel or
dark tone to harmonize with coat.  Disqualify yellow eyes.  Yellow
eyes are a bright colour like that of lemon, not to be confused with
the light yellowish brown.

EARS: Set slightly above the eye line but not too high on the head,
lobular, long and wide with leather extending to nose.

NECK: Round and of medium length, strong and muscular, free of
throatiness, set to carry head with dignity, but arch not accentuated.

coupled.
Topline: Level or slight, straight slope from withers.
Loin: Strong.
Chest: Well-developed brisket extending to elbow neither too broad
nor too narrow.  The ribs well-sprung, but not so well-sprung that
they interfere with the movement of the front assembly.
Underline and belly: Flanks not showing tuck up.

carried either slightly below or above the level of the back.  The tail
is tapered, lively and covered with hair with moderate feathering.

### LIMBS



### FOREQUARTERS:


General appearance: Forelegs medium in length, straight and wellboned, but not so short as to handicap for field work or so heavy to
appear clumsy.
Shoulder: Sloping, clean and muscular.
Pastern: Strong with no suggestion of weakness.  Front dewclaws are
permissible.
Forefeet: Size of feet to harmonize with size of dog.  Toes closely
grouped, webbed and well-padded

### HINDQUARTERS:


General appearance: The whole rear assembly shows strength and
drive.  Legs from hock joint to foot pad moderate in length, strong
and straight with good bone structure.
Hips: Well-developed.
Thigh: Well-developed.
Hock joint: Slightly rounded, should not be small and sharp in
contour, moderately angulated.
Hock: Parallel.
Hind feet: Size of feet to harmonize with size of dog.  Toes closely
grouped, webbed and well-padded.

GAIT / MOVEMENT: The American Water Spaniel moves with
well-balanced reach and drive.  Watching a dog move towards one,
there should be no signs of elbows being out.  Upon viewing the dog
from the rear, one should get the impression that the hind legs, which
should be well-muscled and not cowhocked, move as nearly parallel
as possible, with hocks doing their full share of work and flexing
well, thus giving the appearance of power and strength.

### COAT


Hair: Coat can range from marcel (uniform waves) to closely curled.
The amount of waves or curls can vary from one area to another on
the dog.



FCI-St. N°301 / 22.01.1999
It is important to have undercoat to provide sufficient density to be of
protection against weather, water or punishing cover, yet not too
coarse or too soft.  The throat, neck and rear of the dog well-covered
with hair.  The ear well-covered with hair on both sides with ear
canal evident upon inspection.  Forehead covered with short smooth
hair and without topknot.  Tail covered with hair to tip with moderate
feathering.  Legs have moderate feathering with waves or curls to
harmonize with coat of dog.  Coat may be trimmed to present a wellgroomed appearance; the ears may be shaved; but neither is required.

Colour: Colour either solid liver, brown or dark chocolate.  A little
white on toes and chest permissible.

SIZE AND WEIGHT: 15 to 18 inches for either sex.  Males
weighing 30-45 lbs.  Females weighing 25-40 lbs.  Females tend to
be slightly smaller than the males.  There is no preference for size
within the given range of either sex providing correct proportion,
good substance and balance is maintained.

FAULTS : Any departure from the foregoing points should be
considered a fault and the seriousness with which the fault should be
regarded should be in exact proportion to its degree and its effect
upon the health and welfare of the dog.

### DISQUALIFYING FAULTS:


•
Aggressive or overly shy.
•
Any dog clearly showing physical or behavioural abnormalities.
•
Yellow eyes.
.


### N.B.:


•
Male animals should have two apparently normal testicles fully
descended into the scrotum.
•
Only functionally and clinically healthy dogs, with breed
typical conformation should be used for breeding.
