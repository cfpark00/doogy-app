Section  1.1   Continental Pointing



Dogs.
With working trial.

BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: The Deutsch Drahthaar is a
rough coated pointing dog whose initial breeding started at the end of
the 19th century (Griffon Korthals), and that has been systematically
bred from the beginning of this century based on the ideas of
„Hegewald“ (Sigismund Freiherr von Zedlitz and Neukirch) with the
sealed aim of creating an assertive, efficient wirehaired German
gundog. In accordance with the principle of „by working ability to
type“ and  with consequent regard to freedom of breeding, within a
short time a gundog has been developed from the best of the rough
coated types (Pudelpointer, Griffon Korthals, German Broken
Coated Pointing Dog) and by using the German Shorthaired Pointer,
that excels through his useful weatherproof coat and his versatility in
all fields of practical hunting. Due to these characteristics, the
Deutsch Drahthaar within a few decades has developed to become
the most popular and well-tried among the large gundog breeds in
Germany as well as in many countries of the world.
