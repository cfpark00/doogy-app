Schnauzer-


Molossoid breeds-


### Swiss Mountain and



Cattle Dogs.

Section  2.2
Molossoid breeds,


Mountain type.

Without working trial.

SHORT HISTORICAL SUMMARY: The breed originated in the
island of Newfoundland from indigenous dogs and the big black bear
dog introduced by the Vikings after the year 1100.  With the advent
of European fishermen a variety of new breeds helped to shape and
reinvigorate the breed, but the essential characteristics remained.
When the colonization of the island began in 1610, the
Newfoundland Dog was already largely in possession of his proper
morphology and natural behaviour.  These features allowed him to
withstand the rigours of the extreme climate and sea’s adversity
while pulling heavy loads on land or serving as water and lifeguard
dog.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: The Newfoundland is massive, with
powerful body, well muscled and well coordinated in his
movements.

IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS: The length of the body from the
point of shoulders to the point of buttock is greater than the height at
the withers.  The body is compact.


FCI-St. N° 50 / 06.11.1996
The body of the bitch may be slightly longer and is less massive than
that of the dog.  The distance from the withers to the underside of the
chest is slightly greater than the distance from the underside of the
chest to the ground.

BEHAVIOUR AND TEMPERAMENT: The Newfoundland’s
expression reflects benevolence and softness.  Dignified, joyful and
creative, he is known for his sterling gentleness and serenity.

HEAD: Massive.  The head of the bitch follows the same general
conformation as the male’s one, but is less massive.

### CRANIAL REGION:


Skull: Broad, with slightly arched crown and strongly developed
occipital bone.
Stop: Evident, but never abrupt.

### FACIAL REGION:


Nose: Large, well pigmented, nostrils well developed.   Colour:
Black on black and white and black dogs, brown on brown dogs.
Muzzle: Definitely square, deep and moderately short, covered with
short, fine hair and free from wrinkles.  The corners of the mouth are
evident, but not excessively pronounced.
Flews: Soft.
Jaws/Teeth: Scissors or level bite.

EYES: Relatively small, moderately deep set; they are wide apart
and show no haw.  Colour: Dark brown in black and white and black
dogs, lighter shades permitted in brown dogs.

EARS: Relatively small, triangular with rounded tips, well set back
on the side of the head and close lying.  When the ear of the adult
dog is brought forward, it reaches to the inner corner of the eye on
the same side.

NECK: Strong, muscular, well set in the shoulders, long enough to
permit dignified head carriage.  The neck should not show excessive
dewlap.


FCI-St. N° 50 / 06.11.1996

BODY: Bone structure is massive throughout.  Viewed from the
side, the body is deep and vigorous.
Top line: Level and firm from the withers to the croup.
Back: Broad.
Loin: Strong and well-muscled.
Croup: Broad, sloping at an angle of about 30°.
Chest: Broad, full and deep, with good spread of ribs.
Abdomen and underline: Almost level and never tucked up.

### LIMBS:



### FOREQUARTERS:


General appearance: The forelegs are straight and parallel also when
the dog is walking or slowly trotting.
Shoulders: Very well muscled and well laid back.
Elbows: Close to the chest.
Pasterns: Slightly sloping.
Forefeet: Large and proportionate to the body, well rounded and
tight, with firm and compact toes.  Webbing of toes is present.

### HINDQUARTERS:


General appearance: Because driving power for pulling loads,
swimming, or covering ground efficiently is largely dependent upon
the hindquarters, the rear structure of the Newfoundland is of prime
importance.  The pelvis has to be strong, broad and long.
Upper thighs: Wide and muscular.
Stifle: Well bent, but not so as to give a crouching appearance.
Lower thighs: Strong and fairly long.
Hocks: Relatively short, well let down and well apart, parallel to
each other; they turn neither in nor out.
Hindfeet: Firm and tight.  Dewclaws, if present, should have been
removed

TAIL: The tail acts as a rudder when the Newfoundland is
swimming; therefore, it is strong and broad at the base.  When the
dog is standing, the tail hangs down with, possibly, a little curve at
the tip, reaching to or slightly below the hocks.


FCI-St. N° 50 / 06.11.1996
When the dog is in motion or excited, the tail is carried straight out
with slight upward curve, but never curled over the back nor curved
inward between the legs.

GAIT/MOVEMENT: The Newfoundland moves with good reach
of the forelegs and strong drive of the hindquarters, giving the
impression of effortless power.  A slight roll of the back is natural.
As the speed increases, the dog tends to single track with the topline
remaining level.

### COAT



Hair: The Newfoundland has a water resistent double coat.  The
outer coat is moderately long and straight with no curl.  A slight
wave is permissible.  The undercoat is soft and dense, denser in
winter than in summer, but always found to some extent on the croup
and chest.  The hair on the head, muzzle and ears is short and fine.
The front and rear legs are feathered.  The tail is completely covered
with long, dense hair, but does not form a flag.  Trimming and
scissoring are not encouraged.

Colour: Black, white and black and brown.
• Black: The traditional colour is black.  The colour has to be even
as much as possible, but a slight tinge of sunburn is permissible.
White markings on chest, toes and/or tip of tail are permissible.
• White and black: This variety is of historical significance for the
breed.  The preferred pattern of markings is black head with,
preferably, a white blaze extending onto the muzzle, black saddle
with even markings and black croup and upper tail.  The
remaining parts are to be white and can show a minimum of
ticking.
• Brown: The brown colour goes from chocolate to bronze.  White
markings on chest, toes and/or tip of tail are permissible.  White
and black dogs and brown dogs are to be shown in the same class
as blacks.




FCI-St. N° 50 / 06.11.1996

For adult males     71cm (28 inches),
for adult bitches   66cm (26 inches).
The average weight is  approximately 68kg for males,

approximately 54kg for bitches.
Large size is desirable, but is not to be favoured over symmetry,
general soundness, power of the structure and correct gait.

considered a fault and the seriousness with which the fault should be
regarded should be in exact proportion to its degree and its effect
upon the health and welfare of the dog.
