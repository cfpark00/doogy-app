BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: For hundreds of years the
Lapps have used dogs of the same type as Lapponian Herder as
reindeer herders.  Acceptance to the breed register was started in the
1950’s.  At that time the modern Finnish Lapphund and the
Lapponian Herder were still recognized as the same breed.  The
Lapponian Herder was separated into its own breed 10.12.1966, as it
had been noted that two different reindeer herding breeds existed.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: A herding spitz, medium sized,
clearly longer than the height at the withers.  The bone and muscles
are strong.  The dog is muscular, however must not give the
impression of being heavy.  The sex should be clearly stamped.  The
coat is suitably adapted for the arctic climate.

IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS: The length of the body is about
10% longer than the height at the withers.  The depth of the body is
about half of the height at the withers.

BEHAVIOUR / TEMPERAMENT: Docile, calm, friendly,
energetic and willing to serve.  Barks readily when working.
