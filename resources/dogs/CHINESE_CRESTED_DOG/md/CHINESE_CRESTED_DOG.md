BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: The Chinese Crested Dog
comes in two varieties - the Hairless and the Powder Puff. The
‘Hairless’ have a crest of hair on their head extending part way
down their neck, ‘socks’ covering their toes, and a plume on their
tail. The rest of their body is, as their name implies, hairless. The
‘Powder Puff’ variety is covered entirely with a veil of long soft
hair. While it is difficult to pinpoint their origin, it is said that they
were owned by families of the Han Dynasty of China. The Chinese
Cresteds were developed at this time as guardians of the treasure
houses and, in a larger, heavier form, as hunting dogs. They were
seen at shows in America from 1885 to 1926 but then were rarely
ever seen for some fifty years.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: A small, active and graceful dog;
medium-to fine-boned, smooth hairless body, with hair on feet, head
and tail only; or covered with a soft veil of hair.  Two distinct types
of this breed: Deer type, racy and fine-boned, and Cobby type,
heavier in body and bone.

BEHAVIOUR AND TEMPERAMENT: Happy, never vicious.

HEAD: Smooth, without excess wrinkles.  Distance from base of
skull to stop equal to distance from stop to tip of nose. Head
presenting graceful appearance with alert expression.



FCI-St. N° 288  / 15.09.2021


### CRANIAL REGION:


Skull: Slightly rounded and elongated.
Stop: Slightly pronounced, but not extreme.

### FACIAL REGION:


Nose: A prominent feature, narrow in keeping with muzzle.  Any
colour nose acceptable.
Muzzle: Tapering slightly but never pointed, lean without flews.
Lips: Tight and thin.
Jaws / Teeth: Jaws strong, with perfect, regular scissor bite, i.e. the
upper teeth closely overlapping the lower teeth and set square to the
jaws.  The hairless variety will have the primitive trait of
forward pointing canines and should not be penalised for
absence of full dentition.
Cheeks: Cleanly chiselled, lean and flat, tapering into muzzle.

EYES: So dark as to appear black.  Little or no white showing.
Medium size, almond in shape. Set wide apart.

EARS: Set low: highest point of base of ear level with outside
corner of eye.  Large and erect, with or without fringe, except in
Powder Puffs where drop ears are permissible.

NECK: Lean, free from throatiness, long and sloping gracefully into
strong shoulders. When moving, carried high and slightly arched.

BODY: Medium to long, supple.
Back: Level.
Loin: Taut.
Croup: Well rounded and muscular.
Chest: Rather broad and deep, not barrel-ribbed. Breast bone not
prominent. Brisket extending to elbows.
Underline and belly: Moderate tuck-up.

TAIL: Set high, carried up or out when in motion. Long and
tapering, fairly straight, not curled or twisted to either side, falling
naturally when at rest. Plume long and flowing, confined to lower
two-thirds of tail. Sparse plume acceptable.

FCI-St. N° 288  / 15.09.2021

### SIZE AND WEIGHT:


Ideal height at the withers: Males: 28-33 cm. Females: 23–30 cm.

FAULTS: Any departure from the foregoing points should be
considered a fault and the seriousness with which the fault should be
regarded should be in exact proportion to its degree and its effect
upon the health and welfare of the dog.


### DISQUALIFYING FAULTS


•
Aggressive or overly shy.
•
Any dog clearly showing physical or behavioural abnormalities.

### N.B.:


•  Male animals should have two apparently normal testicles fully
descended into the scrotum.
•  Only functionally and clinically healthy dogs, with breed typical
conformation should be used for breeding.
