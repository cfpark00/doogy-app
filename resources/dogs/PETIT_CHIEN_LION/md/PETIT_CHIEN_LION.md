BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: In the Amiens Cathedral, the
construction of which dates back to the XIII° century, one can see,
carved in stone, two Lowchen which perfectly represent the breed.
In the XV° century its distinctive silhouette was often depicted in
tapestries.  The breed was cherished by the ladies of the court of
Burgundy.  It was especially in the 17th century that the breed was
represented in old masterpieces.  Buffon describes it very precisely
in his “Histoire Naturelle”, stressing its rarity.  At the same period
the Swedish naturalist, Linné also mentions it.  The Lowchen was
once called “Bichon Little Lion Dog”.  The French Breed Club was
founded November 18th, 1947.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: A small intelligent dog, gay with a
lively and alert expression; overall robust with good bone- short and
well proportioned body- head carried high – pronounced tuck-up.
The movement is proud and determined, accentuated by the floating
mane from the lion clip; the unclipped areas should be completely
natural and on no account should they be shaped.
The lion clip is obligatory for showing.




FCI-St. N° 233 / 02.04.2004
IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS: The body is square.  The length
of the body (point of shoulder to point of buttock) is equal to the
height at the withers.  The length of the muzzle represents
approximately 2/3 of the skull.

BEHAVIOUR / TEMPERAMENT: Very affectionate and obedient
with its masters, attentive and receptive, at ease in all circumstances;
capable of being calm and discreet on command.  His forthright and
tender look tries to understand what is expected of him.

HEAD: Relatively short and quite broad from the top of the skull to
the muzzle; carried high.

### CRANIAL REGION:


Skull: Relatively flat: as broad as it is long.
Stop: Moderately marked.

### FACIAL REGION:


Nose: Black (total pigmentation is obligatory), except for brown
coats and derivatives.  In the latter case, the nose is dark brown (total
pigmentation obligatory).  The nose is well in line with the topline of
the muzzle.
Muzzle: Rather broad, straight.
Lips: Tight and black, except for brown coats and derivatives, in
which case, the lips are dark brown.
Jaws/Teeth: Strong teeth, complete dentition with scissor bite.
Absence of the PM1 is tolerated.

EYES: Set well forward, the eyes are large, very dark, round and
well spaced; must be forward looking.  The lids are totally
pigmented.

EARS: Set low (level with eyes).  Moderately long, capable of
almost reaching, if pulled, half the length of the muzzle; pendant,
well fringed.  The fringes can reach, at least, to the end of the nose.

NECK: Of good length, slightly arched, merging smoothly into the
shoulders and withers.
