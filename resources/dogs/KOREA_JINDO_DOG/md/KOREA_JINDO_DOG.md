BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY : There is no written record
about the origin of the Korea Jindo Dog, but many authorities agree
that this breed has existed for several thousands of years in the
Island of Jindo, which is located at the South-West end of the Korean
peninsula.  About the ancient origin, however, among different
theories, the main accepted is, that the Jindo Dog is indigenous to
Korea; the breed has been well preserved in this island due to the
transportation difficulties in those days.  In Korea, Korea Jindo Dogs
are called Jindo-kae or Jindo-kyon.  Kae or Kyon are Korean words
for dog.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: The Korea Jindo Dog is a wellproportioned medium-sized dog used for hunting and guarding.  With
erect ears and a rolled or sickle-shaped tail it should be a vivid
expression of agility, strength, alertness and dignity.

IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS: Ratio between height at withers:
length of body = 10 : 10,5.

BEHAVIOUR / TEMPERAMENT: The Korea Jindo Dog has a
very strong instinct for hunting and is bold, brave, alert and careful,
not tempted easily and impetuous.  But most of all he is extremely
faithful to his master.
On the whole he is not fond of other animals, especially males.  He
also has a good sense of direction.


FCI-St. N° 334 / 13.07.2005
A one-man dog, he readily accepts a new master, but never forgets
his attachment towards the former master who raised him from
puppyhood. He keeps himself clean and eats sparingly.

HEAD: In general, the head forms a blunt triangle when viewed
from above and does not make the dog appear clumsy or coarse.

CRANIAL REGION: The skull is of medium size in proportion to
the body. The top is slightly rounded and tapering down gradually to
the eyes.
The width between the ears is moderate in proportion to the size of
the head.
Stop: Well defined, but not too abrupt.  There is a slight furrow
extending up towards forehead.

### FACIAL REGION:


Nose:  Black.  In case of white dog, flesh colour is permitted.
Muzzle:  The muzzle should not be bulky nor turned upward.
Lips:  Black, closing tightly, thin and not pendulous; upper lip
slightly covers the lower lip.
Teeth:  Very strong; scissors bite.
Cheeks:  Well developed, dry and moderately round when viewed
from side and front; narrowing to the end of the nose.

EYES:  Dark brown in colour, rather small  in proportion to the size
of the head, almond in shape and very lively; the outer corner of
both eyes is slanted towards the ears.

EARS:  Of medium size, triangular in shape, thick and perfectly
erect; ears, set neither high nor low, point slightly forward in line
with the back of the neck.  Inside of ears, a fine and dense texture of
coat is desirable.

NECK: Rather well-balanced and thick without dewlap, well
muscled and strong.  The Korea Jindo Dog carries his neck proudly
and well arched when excited.




FCI-St. N° 334 / 13.07.2005


### BODY


Back: Strong and straight.
Loin: Well muscled, taut, lean and narrower than the rib cage.
Chest: Strong and moderately deep, but not too broad.  The deepest
point of chest reaches just above the elbow, but same level with the
elbow is also acceptable. Ribs well sprung.  Brisket well developed.
Underline and belly: Drawn up.


TAIL: When let down, the tip of the tail should reach the hock.
Root rather set high, stands straight firmly and should not sway when
the dog moves.  Sickle-shaped or rolled, the end of the tail touching
the back or the flank.  Should not be too curled.  The tail is profusely
feathered.

### LIMBS

front.

FCI-St. N° 334 / 13.07.2005
GAIT / MOVEMENT: The gait of Korea Jindo Dog is powerful
and steady. The back should remain firm and level.  He trots
carrying his head high, but when speed increases, the head is carried
rather low, almost at the level of the shoulders.  The upper part of the
tail moves slightly according to the change of direction of the dog.

### COAT


Hair: The Korea Jindo Dog has a double coat. Undercoat is soft,
dense, light in colour, but sufficient to support the outercoat.
Outercoat is stiff and stands somewhat off body.  Comparing with the
hair of the body, the hair on head, legs and ears is shorter and the hair
on the neck, withers, back and rump is longer.  The hair on tail and
back of thighs is longer than on the rest of the body.

Colour:  The colours of the Korea Jindo Dog are red fawn, white,
black, black and tan, wolf grey and brindle.
