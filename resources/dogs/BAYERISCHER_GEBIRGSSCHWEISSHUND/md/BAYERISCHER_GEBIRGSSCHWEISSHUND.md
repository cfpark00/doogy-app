ORIGIN: Germany.

### DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THE OFFICIAL VALID



### STANDARD: 22.08.2017.



UTILIZATION: In accordance with the hunting requirements
as a specialist for the search of hoofed game, the Bavarian
Mountain Scent Hound has to show all the of him required
abilities to be useful for the more difficult search.
This usefulness must be confirmed by the relevant working
trials.

### FCI-CLASSIFICATION:


Group   6
Scenthounds and related
breeds.

Section 2
Leash (Scent) hounds.
With working trial, which take note of the relevant hunting
requirements.



BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: All Liam Hounds (Leithunde)
and Leashhounds (Schweisshunde) are descended from the original
hunting dogs, the “Bracken”.  All pure “Bracken” have the finest
nose for following ground scent and trail; they are firm on scent,
have a strongly developed will to follow a trail and are readily giving
tongue on scent.
Only the most reliable and perseverant Bracken were chosen from
the pack to be used on the leash to search for the lost trail of the
hunted game.  From those most calm and biddable Bracken, the
Liam Hounds (Leithunde, working only on natural, cold scent) and
the “Scent Hounds” (Schweisshunde, the so called “spoilt Liam
Hounds”, working the trial of wounded game) were later bred.
Through crossing of genetically fairly close breeds at the end of the
18th and beginning of the 19th century, the present day Hanoverian
Scenthound evolved.



FCI-St. N°217  /    22.09.2017
After the Revolution in 1848, in fact, after the break-up of the large
hunting estates and the replacement of the previous hunting methods
by stalking and hiding (waiting for the game) and at the same time
with the improvement of the firearms, the dog was needed “after the
shot”.
Specialized in firmly working on the leash, one could not dispense
with the loud chase, perseverance and keenness, especially in
mountain regions.  There the Hanovarian Scenthound proved too
heavy.
To achieve the desired accomplishments, even in difficult mountain
territory, Baron Karg-Bebenburg, Reichenhall, bred the racy and
ennobled lighter Mountain Scenthound after 1870, by crossing
Hanovarian Scenthounds and red Mountain Scenthounds.  More and
more these dogs ousted other breeds from the mountain regions so
that the Bavarian Mountain Scenthound is, today, the classical
companion for the professional hunter and gamekeeper.
In 1912 the Club for Bavarian Mountain Scenthounds was founded
with its seat in Munich.  It is the only recognized Club for Bavarian
Mountain Scenthounds in Germany.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: An altogether balanced, somewhat
light, very mobile and muscular, medium size dog.  The body is
slightly longer than high, slightly higher at rear, standing on not too
