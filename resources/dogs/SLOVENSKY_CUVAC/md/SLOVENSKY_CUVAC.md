### SLOVENSKÝ ČUVAČ


(Slovakian Chuvach)





St-FCI n°142/ 04.06.1996
TRANSLATION: Mrs. Chris Seidler. Official language (DE).

ORIGIN:  Slovakian Republik.

### DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THE OFFICIAL VALID



### STANDARD: 18.08.1965.



UTILIZATION: This derives from his age old use as a shepherd
and mountain dog in bare high mountain regions and as a guard dog
for farms and borders.

FCI-CLASSIFICATION:  Group 1 Sheepdogs and Cattle Dogs



(except Swiss Cattle



Dogs).

Section 1 Sheepdogs.

Without working trial.

BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY:  The breed group of white
mountain dogs is derived from Arctic wolves, whose remains from
pre-ice age have been preserved in the mountainous regions of
Europe to the edge of the glaciers.  These are the north slopes of the
Caucasus, the Balkans, specially the Rodope mountains, the
Carpathians, specially the Tatra, the northern slopes of the Abruzzi
and Alps and finally the Pyrenees.  In these colder and damper areas,
the alleged type of mountain dog is also accompanied by remains of
flora and fauna whose nearest location were still found in
Scandinavia by the Swedish explorer Wahlenberg.  A similar
connection with Nordic domestic animals we can, for example, find
in the Tatra and Carpathian region with the Huzul horse, whose
nearest relation is the Gudbrandstal horse.  So it is with the Tatra
Chuvach, whose Nordic analogy is the Pomeranian Shepherd dog
(Pommernscher Hütehund) and others.
Slovak alpine farming has a very ancient tradition.  The Tatra
Chuvach, together with the mountain sheep, the Huzul horse and the
typical mountain inhabitants, form the basis for an economy which
assumes the utilization of the pastures through animal husbandry.



St-FCI n°142/ 04.06.1996
The Slovak mountain people were largely free people, not
suppressed by medieval forced labour, which protected the frontiers
and paid its dues merely in the form of “sheep’s cheese”.  Their
organization was called “Wallachischer Bund (Union)” (Valasski
Opasek), whose centre (until the repeal of forced labour) was in
Kaschau.  The members of this, basically, herding and military
organization, carried out their service on the mountain meadows,
always together with their typical dogs, the watch dogs of the Tatra
and they were always depicted with them.
As a good guard, watch dog and companion as well as guide for the
shepherds, the Tatra Chuvach has also proved his worth in the
guarding of cattle, driving poultry and other domestic animals to
pasture, as well as guarding different objects.  Holiday makers
visiting the mountain farmers to buy cheese and other products found
pleasure in the thickly coated puppies and so transferred the breed to
the low-lands, where they were not seldom regarded as a luxury
breed because of their unusual appearance.
On the Polish side of the Tatra, where a similar breed, the Goral
Dogs (Mountain Dogs), are kept, specially powerful animals are
called “Liptauer” by the people which points to the Slovak origin.
So the breeding region of the Tatra Chuvach has a topographic
boundary.
The Stud Book of the Tatra Chuvach in Czechoslovakia was founded
more than thirty years ago by Professor Anton Hruza of the Brno
Veterinary College.  The basic material stemmed from the area of the
places Liptovska Luzna, Kokava, Vychodna v. Tatrach and the
neighbourhood of Rachovo in the Carpathians.  The first breeding
establishment had the name “Ze zlaté studny” (of the Golden
Fountain) and was founded in Svitavy and Brno.  The Carpathian
kennel had the prefix “Z Hoverla” (Of Hoverla).  Since then the club
for Tatra Chuvach breeders, with its headquarters in Bratislava, has
kept exact records and held exhibitions, assessments, competitions
and shows in all regions of the republic.  Further old blood lines stem
from the places Liptovské Hole, Velky Choc, Zakopané, Martin,
Jedlova and Jeseniky.
The widest spread lines are those of Topas, Uran, Simba, Hrdos,
Ibro, Cuvo, Bundas, Dinar, Samko, Bojar, Olaf and others.



St-FCI n°142/ 04.06.1996
Genetically, the Tatra Chuvach can be characterised as a “leucistic”
Mountain Dog with black muzzle and to a lesser part as “flavistic”
dog with brown muzzle and paler eye.  From the combination of the
mentioned genetic types, of which the former is dominant, stems a
certain difference in the shading of colour, of the pigmentation of the
eyelids, eyes, muzzle, lips and membranes.
Through strict selection favouring the first type, the judges and
breeders achieved the type required by the following standard and its
stabilising by breeders.
The number of club members with breeding stock and kennels has
recently been counted as towards 200.  Living registered dogs, at
present in the republic, number nearly 800.
The quality of our breeding of the Tatra Chuvach is confirmed by
favourable assessment at international shows (Prague, Brno, Liberec,
Bratislava, Leipzig and others) and this with strong foreign
competition.

GENERAL APPEARANCE:  The Tatra Chuvach’s breed
characteristics conform in type with those of a mountain dog of firm
constitution, impressive appearance and thick white coat.  He has a
strong bone, a lively temperament and is vigilant, fearless and alert.
For centuries he has been accustomed to the harsh climate of the
Slovakian mountains, especially the Tatra mountains.  His format is
well within the shape of a moderate rectangle, the body resting on
strong rather high limbs.  His vigilance and alertness helped to give
him his name, as the Slovak word “Cuvat” means to hear.

BEHAVIOUR AND TEMPERAMENT: He is boundlessly faithful
and courageous, always ready to fight off any intruder, be it even
bears and wolves.  In order to distinguish him from wild beasts in the
night, he is, according to ancient tradition, only bred in white.

### COAT


Hair: With the exception on head and limbs, the hair form a dense
coat without a parting on the back and without feathering on tail and
buttocks.  Males have a striking name.  Hair is short and close on
head and legs, slightly longer on rearside of legs.  Short hair
gradually merges from set-on of ears into the mane.  Undercoat is
completely covered by long hair in top coat.  The latter is 5 to 15cm.
Most wavy on mane, elsewhere moderately wavy, forming numerous
waves across the back which merge into each other.  Single waves,
not joined, are undesired.
Required is a light dense coat.
Undercoat: hair fine and dense, in length up to half or two thirds of
hair of top coat.  The undercoat is shed during the summer, so the
coat loses its density, but remains light throughout the year on
account of the wavy topcoat which forms no parting on the back.

Colour: White.  Yellowish shading at set on of ears permitted but not
desired.  Distinct yellow patches are not permitted.
