expression. Rather widely set with corners clearly defined.

pale blue, blue or blue flecked permissible only in blue merles.

slightly rounded, moderately wide at base and set about 8 cm (3.5
ins.) apart. Carried so that tips are slightly wide of straight line drawn
from tip of nose through centre of eyes, and set well back so that
they can be laid flat along neck.

NECK: Muscular, well developed, in proportion to dog’s build,
fitting into well sloping shoulders.

BODY: Fairly long and strong.
Topline: Level.
Loin: Waist clearly defined.
Chest: Moderately broad with prominent breast bone. Brisket deep.
Well sprung ribs.

long (to touch or nearly touch ground). Carried low when standing
but may be lifted a little above body when moving, not curled over
back.

tricolour with brindle points and tri colour with red points.
All of the above with or without typical white markings on head,
neck chest, underparts, legs and feet, white tail tip.  White should
nod predominate on body or head where it should never surround the
eyes.  Nose and eye rims must be black.  Liver and dilute colours
highly undesirable.

### SIZE AND WEIGHT:



Ideal height at withers: 30 cm.

Weight: In proportion to size with overall balance the prime
consideration.

FAULTS:  Any departure from the foregoing points should be
considered a fault and the seriousness with which the fault should be
regarded should be in exact proportion to its degree and its effect
upon the health and welfare of the dog and on its ability to perform
its traditional work.
