### AMERICAN COCKER SPANIEL




FCI-St. N° 167 / 13.09.2021

### ORIGIN: U.S.A.



### DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THE OFFICIAL VALID



### STANDARD: 27.07.2021.



UTILIZATION: Flushing dog, companion.

### FCI-CLASSIFICATION:


Group 8
Retrievers, Flushing



Dogs, Water Dogs.

Section 2
Flushing Dogs.

Without working trial.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: The American Cocker Spaniel is the
smallest member of the Sporting Group.  He has a sturdy, compact
body and a cleanly chiselled and refined head, with the overall dog in
complete balance and of ideal size.  He stands well up at the shoulder
on straight forelegs with a topline sloping slightly toward strong,
moderately bent, muscular quarters.  He is a dog capable of
considerable speed, combined with great endurance.  Above all, he
must be free and merry, sound, well balanced throughout and in
action show a keen inclination to work.  A dog well balanced in all
parts is more desirable than a dog with strongly contrasting good
points and faults.

IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS: The measurement from the
breastbone to back of thigh is slightly longer than the measurement
from the highest point of withers to the ground.  The body must be of
sufficient length to permit a straight and free stride; the dog never
appears long and low.

BEHAVIOUR / TEMPERAMENT: Equable in temperament with
no suggestion of timidity.

HEAD: To attain a well proportioned head, which must be in
balance with the rest of the dog, it embodies an intelligent, alert, soft
and appealing expression.


FCI-St. N° 167 / 13.09.2021


### CRANIAL REGION:


Skull: Rounded but not exaggerated with no tendency toward
flatness; the eyebrows are clearly defined.  The bony structure
beneath the eyes is well chiselled.
Stop: Pronounced.

### FACIAL REGION:


Nose: Of sufficient size to balance the muzzle and foreface, with
well developed nostrils typical of a sporting dog.  It is black in colour
in the blacks, black and tans and black and whites; in other colours it
may be brown, liver or black, the darker the better.  The colour of the
nose harmonizes with the colour of the eye rim.
Muzzle: Broad and deep.  To be in correct balance, the distance from
the stop to the tip of nose is one half the distance from the stop up
over the crown to the base of the skull.
Lips: The upper lip is full and of sufficient depth to cover the lower
jaw.
Jaws/Teeth: Jaws square and even.  Teeth strong and sound, not too
small and meet in a scissor bite.
Cheeks: Not prominent.

EYES: Eyeballs are round and full and look directly forward.  The
shape of the eye rims gives a slightly almond-shaped appearance; the
eye is not weak or goggled.  The colour of the iris is dark brown and
in general the darker the better.

EARS: Lobular, long, of fine leather, well feathered, and placed no
higher than a line to the lower part of the eye.

NECK: The neck is sufficiently long to allow the nose to reach the
ground easily, muscular and free from pendulous « throatiness ».  It
rises strongly from the shoulders and arches slightly as it tapers to
join the head.

### BODY:


Topline: Sloping slightly toward muscular quarters.
Back: Strong and sloping evenly and slightly downward from the
shoulders to the set-on of the docked tail.


FCI-St. N° 167 / 13.09.2021

Chest: Deep, its lowest point no higher than the elbows, its front
sufficiently wide for adequate heart and lung space, yet not so wide
as to interfere with the straight forward movement of the forelegs.
Ribs are deep and well sprung.

TAIL: The docked tail is set on and carried on a line with the topline
of the back, or slightly higher; never straight up like a terrier and
never so low as to indicate timidity.  When the dog is in motion the
tail action is merry.

### LIMBS



### FOREQUARTERS:


General appearance: Forelegs are parallel, straight, strongly boned,
muscular and set close to the body well under the scapulae.
Shoulder: Well laid back forming an angle with the upper arm of
approximately 90° which permits the dog to move his forelegs in an
easy manner with forward reach.  Shoulders are clean-cut and
sloping without protrusion and so set that the upper points of the
withers are at an angle which permits a wide spring of rib.
Elbow: When viewed from the side with the forelegs vertical, the
elbow is directly below the highest point of the shoulder blade.
Pastern: Short and strong.  Dewclaws on forelegs may be removed.
Forefeet: Compact, large, round and firm with horny pads; they turn
neither in nor out.

### HINDQUARTERS:


General appearance: When viewed from behind, the hind legs are
parallel when in motion and at rest.  They are strongly boned and
muscled.
Hips: Wide and quarters well rounded and muscular.
Upper thighs: Powerful and clearly defined.
Stifle: Moderate angulation of the stifle.  Strong and there is no
slippage of it in motion or when standing.
Hocks: Strong and well let down.  Dewclaws on hind legs may be
removed.



FCI-St. N° 167 / 13.09.2021
Hind feet: Compact, large, round and firm with horny pads; they turn
neither in nor out.


GAIT / MOVEMENT: The American Cocker Spaniel, though the
smallest of the sporting dogs, possesses a typical sporting dog gait.
Prerequisite to good movement is balance between the front and the
rear assemblies.  He drives with strong, powerful rear quarters and is
properly constructed in the shoulders and forelegs so that he can
reach forward without constriction in a full stride to counterbalance
the driving force from the rear.  Above all, his gait is coordinated,
smooth and effortless.  The dog must cover ground with his action;
excessive animation should not be mistaken for proper gait.

### COAT


Hair: On the head, short and fine; on body, medium length, with
enough undercoating to give protection.  The ears, chest, abdomen
and legs are well feathered, but not so excessively as to hide the
Cocker Spaniel’s true lines and movement or affect his appearance
and function as a moderately coated sporting dog.  The texture is
most important.  The coat is silky, flat or slightly wavy and of a
texture which permits easy care.  Excessive coat or curly or cottony
textured coat shall be severely penalized.  Use of electric clippers on
the back coat is not desirable.  Trimming to enhance the dog’s true
lines should be done to appear as natural as possible.

Colour and markings:
• Black variety: Solid colour black, to include black with tan points.
The black should be jet; shadings of brown or liver in the coat are
not desirable.  A small amount of white on the chest and/or throat
is allowed; white in any other location shall disqualify.
• Any Solid Colour Other Than Black (ASCOB): Any solid colour
other than black, ranging from the lightest cream to darkest red,
including brown and brown with tan points.  The colour shall be
of a uniform shade, but lighter colour of the feathering is
permissible.  A small amount of white on the chest and/or throat
is allowed; white in any other location shall disqualify.


FCI-St. N° 167 / 13.09.2021
• Parti-Colour variety: Two or more solid, well broken colours, one
of which must be white; black and white, red and white (the red
may range from lightest cream to darkest red), brown and white,
and roans, to include any such colour combination with tan
points.  It is preferable that the tan markings be located in the
same pattern as for the tan points in the Black and ASCOB
varieties.  Roans are classified as Parti-Colours and may be of any
of the usual roaning patterns.  Primary colour which is ninety
percent (90%) or more shall disqualify.
• Tan points: The colour of the tan may be from the lightest cream
to the darkest red and is restricted to ten percent (10%) or less of
the colour of the specimen; tan markings in excess of that amount
shall disqualify.  In the case of tan points in the Black or ASCOB
variety, the markings shall be located as follows:

1) A clear tan spot over each eye;

2) On the sides of the muzzle and on the cheeks;

3) On the underside of the ears;

4) On all feet and/or legs;

5) Under the tail;

6) On the chest, optional: presence or absence
shall not be penalized.
Tan markings which are not readily visible, or which amount only to
traces, shall be penalized.  Tan on the muzzle which extends upward,
over and joins shall also be penalized.  The absence of tan markings
in the Black or ASCOB variety in any of the specified locations in
any otherwise tan-pointed dog shall disqualify.

### SIZE:


The ideal height at the withers for an adult dog is 15 inches and for
an adult bitch, 14 inches.  Height may vary one half inch above or
below this ideal.  A dog whose height exceeds 15 1/2 inches or a
bitch whose height exceeds 14 1/2 inches shall be disqualified.  An
adult dog whose height is less than 14 1/2 inches and an adult bitch
whose height is less than 13 1/2 inches shall be penalized.  Height is
determined by a line perpendicular to the ground from the top of the
shoulder blades, the dog standing naturally with its forelegs and
lower hind legs parallel to the line of measurement.


FCI-St. N° 167 / 13.09.2021

FAULTS: Any departure from the foregoing points should be
considered a fault and the seriousness with which the fault should be
regarded should be in exact proportion to its degree and its effect
upon the health and welfare of the dog.

### DISQUALIFYING FAULTS:


• Aggresive or overly shy dogs.
• Any dog clearly showing physical or behavioural abnormalities.
• Colour and markings: The aforementioned colours are the only
acceptable colours or combination of colours.  Any other colours
or combination of colours to disqualify.

• Any Solid Colour Other Than Black variety: White markings
except on chest and throat.
• Parti-Colour variety: Primary colour ninety percent (90%) or
more.

variety in any of the specified locations in an


otherwise tan-pointed dog.
