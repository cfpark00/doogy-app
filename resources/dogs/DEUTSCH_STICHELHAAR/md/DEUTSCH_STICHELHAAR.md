BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: The Deutsch Stichelhaar is
the oldest German rough-coated pointing dog. In 1888, the
cynologist Hans von Kadisch managed to prove that this breed is the
rough-coated variety of the German partridge dog („Hühnerhund“)
and not just another variety of the Short-Haired Pointing Dog. That
means, the Deutsch Stichelhaar has not been newly created, but has
been re-developed from the very few specimens still found in the
country.
In 1892, the „Club Stichelhaar“was founded, renamed  „Verein
Deutsch Stichelhaar“ in 1976. From the beginning, the Club was
devoted to the principles of pure breeding and refused all kinds of
interbreeding to any of the English pointing breeds.

large size with stiff, hard coat and moderate beard. The eyebrows are
pronounced giving a grim appearance to the dog.

### COAT


Hair: On the body the coat should be stiff, harsh and bristly; it is
lying loosely to the body, all hairs on the respective parts of the body
growing the same direction.  It is approximately 4 cm long. On the
shoulders and towards the undersides of the body it is slightly longer
with some straight featherings, running from the throat downwards
along the central line of the chest and the belly. Rather frequently,
there is a hardly visible undercoat on the whole body.
On the muzzle the hair forms a moderately developed beard. On the
bridge of the nose it is short and harsh, neither long nor soft, nor
falling.  On the skull the hair is close lying, short and harsh.  On the
ears it is slightly longer than in the German Short-Haired Pointer and
not as harsh as on the top of the head.
The head should be free from any soft, woolly or silky coat. The
eyebrows are bushy and strong, the hairs standing off forming an
oblique arch.
On the front of the forelegs the short hard coat is flat lying, at the
back there is some what longer feathering from the elbows down to
the pasterns. The backsides of the hindlegs are slightly feathered
almost down to the hocks.

Between the toes the coat is short and softer but not protruding.
The tail is densely and well covered by coat, the hair lying close to
the skin in the direction of their growth. On the underside the coat is
somewhat longer but without forming an off-standing brust or plume.
