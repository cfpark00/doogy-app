BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY:  This breed originates from
the “Bâtard Anglo-Saintongeois”, a type which appeared in the
middle of the XIXth century and which was the result of crossing
between the Saintongeois and the Foxhound. The breed presently
counts approximately 2000 subjects with around 200 births per year.
It makes up the packs of twenty or more deer hunts and one stag
hunt.
The 2007 text was drafted by M. Pierre Astié, President of the “Club
du chien d’ordre” and his committee, in collaboration with Mr.
Raymond Triquet.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: Big, rather powerful dog, resistant
and robust with strong bone which is a reminder of his GasconSaintongeois origins.

### IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS:


The muzzle is slightly shorter than the skull.
The length of the body, from the point of the shoulder to the point of
buttock, is equal to the height at the withers.




FCI-St. N° 323  / 12.01.2009

on damp or bushy terrain. It is a friendly dog, close to humans and
