BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: Although each nation eagerly
designates a breed history for their national breeds, rarely is it
possible to come up with an accurate one, especially when it comes
to livestock protection dogs. The Kangal Dog’s history is also one of
them.   However, it is a breed deeply imbedded in today’s Turkish
culture. It is Turkey’s highly praised National Dog.
It wouldn’t be too unrealistic to say that the Turkish people
migrating from Central Asia whose livelihood primarily relied on
nomadic animal husbandry brought their strong livestock protection
dogs along with them. It is a well-known fact that the dogs protecting
sheep and goats in Central Asia are of various colours.
The question regarding the origins of the Kangal Dog we know today
should be about what caused them to have a more unifying standard
in terms of type and especially colour in Turkey.
It is believed that lies with the area they are highly populated in
Eastern Turkey and the kind of sheep breed they are known to
protect: Akkaraman Sheep.



FCI-St. N°331 / 25.06.2018

They both seem to share the same black mask on a dun coloured coat
across the vast steppes of Eastern Turkey surrounded by high
mountains, creating relatively an isolated population. This suggests a
perfect camouflage and adaptation for both. The breed name, Kangal
seems to come from the town of Kangal off Sivas where the breed
attracted worldwide attention with exceptionally high quality and
uniform specimens.

livestock guarding dog with dark mask. Not aggressive but good
guardian. Capable of great speed. The Kangal is a molossus type

the withers. Depth of chest is approximately 50% of height at the
