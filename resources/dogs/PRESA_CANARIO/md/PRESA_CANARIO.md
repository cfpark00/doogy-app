### Swiss Mountain and



Cattle dogs.


Section 2.1   Molossoid Mastiff type.


Without working trial.

BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: A molossoid type dog,
originating from Tenerife and Gran Canaria (Canary Islands). It is
believed to be the result of matings between the “majorero”, a
prehispanic dog indigenous to these islands, and other molossoids
introduced to the Canary Islands.
These matings produced an ethnical group of catch dogs, of medium
size, brindle, fawn or black with white marking, with a specific
molossoid morphology but yet agile and powerful, having a strong
temperament, robust and lively, loyal character.
During the XVI and XVII centuries, the number of these dogs
increased considerably and numerous references to them in preConquest historical texts, especially in the “Cedularios del Cabildo”
(municipal registers), which explain their duties essentially as guard
dogs and protectors of cattle.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: A medium-sized molossoid dog, with
a rectilinear profile and black mask. Robust and well-proportioned.




FCI-St. N° 346 / 5.10.2023

IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS: The body is longer than the height
at the withers; this characteristic is more noticeable in the female.
Skull-foreface proportion is 60-40%. The width of the skull is 3/5 of
the total length of the head. The distance from elbow to ground should
be 50% of the height at the withers for males and a little less for
females.

### BEHAVIOUR/TEMPERAMENT:


Severe
look;
attentive
expression. Especially suited to guarding and traditionally used for
herding cattle. Balanced temperament and very self-confident. Low
and deep bark. Obedient and docile with family members, very
devoted to its master, but can be suspicious of strangers. Confident
attitude, noble and a little distant. When alert, the stance is firm with
a vigilant attitude.

HEAD:  Massive, brachycephalic and compact in appearance,
covered with thick skin. The shape tends towards a slightly elongated
cube. The cranial-facial lines are parallel or slightly converging.

### CRANIAL REGION:


Skull: Slightly convex in anteroposterior and transversal direction.
Frontal bone tends to be flat. The width is almost identical to the
length. Pronounced zygomatic arch, with well developed cheek and
jaw muscles, but not prominent, covered with loose skin. The occipital
protuberance is only slightly marked.
Stop: The stop is pronounced, but not abrupt. The furrow between the
frontal lobes is well defined and is about two thirds the size of the
skull.

### FACIAL REGION:


Nose: Wide, strong black pigmentation. In line with the muzzle. The
nostrils are large to facilitate breathing.
Muzzle: Shorter than the skull, normally about 40% of the total length
of the head. The width is 2/3 of that of the skull. Very wide base,
narrowing slightly towards the nose. Bridge of the nose is flat and
straight, without ridges.



FCI-St. N° 346 / 5.10.2023

Lips: The upper lip is pendulous, although not excessively. Seen from
the front, the upper and lower lips come together to form an inverted
V. The flews are slightly divergent. The inside of the lips is a dark
colour.
Jaws/Teeth: Scissor bite or slightly undershot bite, max 2 mms. The
dental arch is wide at the canines. The teeth are wide and solidly set.
Large molars, small incisors, well developed canines. The absence of
premolars P1 is not subject to penalisation, given that the catch is
made with incisors and canines, which must be properly aligned
and anchored.

EYES: Slightly oval in shape, of medium size. Set well apart, but
neither sunken nor protruding. Eyelids are black and tight-fitting,
never sagging. The colour varies from dark to medium brown,
depending on the colour of the coat. They should never be light.

EARS: Medium sized, set well apart, with short and fine hair. They
fall naturally on each side of the head. If folded, they are in the shape
of a rose. They are set on slightly above eye level. Ears set too high
and very close on the head are considered unusual. In countries were
cropping is allowed, they must stand erect.

NECK: Shorter than the length of the head. Skin on the underside is
loose, forming a slight dewlap. Solid and straight, it tends to be
cylindrical and muscular. Average length: between 18 and 20 cm.

BODY: Long, broad and deep. Its length is normally 18 or 20 %
longer than its withers height.
Top line: Straight, without deformations and sustained by well
developed but barely visible muscles. Rising slightly from the withers
to the croup. Back apparently hollow, just behind the withers. The
height at the croup is 1,5 cm more than the height at the withers.
Croup: Medium length, broad and rounded. Should not be long as this
would limit movement. The female is usually broader.




FCI-St. N° 346 / 5.10.2023
Chest: With great capacity and well defined pectoral muscles. Seen
from both the front and the side, it should be well let down to at least
the elbow. Thoracic perimeter is usually equal to the height at the
withers plus 30% of the latter, although a bigger proportion is
desirable. Well sprung ribcage.
Underline and belly: Slightly tucked up, never sagging. The flanks are
only slightly pronounced.

TAIL: Thick base, tapering to the tip, down to the hock but no longer.
High set on. In action it rises like a sabre, but without curling nor
leaning towards the back. At rest it hangs straight with a slight curve
at the tip.

### LIMBS



### FOREQUARTERS:


Shoulder: Well laid back.
Upper arm: Well angulated, oblique.
Forearm:  Well balanced, straight. Strong boned and well muscled.
Elbow: Must be neither too close to the ribs nor sticking out.
Metacarpus (Pastern): Very solid and slightly sloping.
Forefeet: Cat feet with rounded toes, not too close together. Well
developed and black pads. Nails are dark, white nails should be
avoided, although they can occur in function of coat colour.

### HINDQUARTERS:


General appearance: Seen from behind, strong and parallel, without
deviation.
Thigh: Long and well muscled thighs.
Stifle (Knee): Angulation not very pronounced but should not be
insufficient.
Metatarsus (Rear pastern): Always well let down.
Hind feet: Slightly longer than the front feet, otherwise identical.

GAIT / MOVEMENT: On the move, the Presa Canario is agile and
supple and should cover a lot of ground. Long reach. The tail is carried
low and the head is carried only a little above the level of the back.
When alert, the head and tail are carried high.


FCI-St. N° 346 / 5.10.2023
SKIN: Thick and elastic. Looser on and around the neck. When alert,
the skin on the head forms symmetrical wrinkles which fan out from
the furrow between the front lobes.

### COAT:


Hair: Short, coarse, flat with no undercoat (it can appear on neck and
on back of the thighs). Rather coarse to the touch. Very short and fine
on the ears; slightly longer on the withers and on the back of thighs.

Colour: All shades of brindle up to sand color. All shades of fawn up
to sand base color. Black. White marks are acceptable on the chest,
around the neck or throat, forefeet and hind feet, but these should be
kept to a minimum. The mask is always black (in fawn and brindle
specimens) and should not spread above eye level.

### SIZE AND WEIGHT:


Height at the withers:  Males:    61 - 66 cm.

Females: 57 - 62 cm.
Weight:
Medium:
Males:
45 to 57 kg

Females: 40 to 50 kg

### FAULTS:


Any departure from the foregoing points should be considered a fault
and the seriousness with which the fault should be regarded should be
in exact proportion to its degree and its effect upon the health and
welfare of the dog.

### MINOR FAULTS:


•
Pincer bite.
•
Too many wrinkles in the craniofacial region.
