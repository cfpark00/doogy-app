### ALASKAN MALAMUTE




FCI-St. N° 243 / 10.03.2023

### ORIGIN: U.S.A.



### DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THE ORIGINAL VALID



### STANDARD: 09.03.2023.



UTILIZATION: Sledge dog.

### FCI-CLASSIFICATION:


Group 5
Spitz and primitive types.

Section 1
Nordic Sledge Dogs.

Without working trial.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: The Alaskan Malamute, one of the
oldest Arctic sledge dogs, is a powerful and substantially built dog
with deep chest and strong, well-muscled body.  The Malamute
stands well over the pads, and this stance gives the appearance of
much activity and a proud carriage, with head erect and eyes alert
showing interest and curiosity.  The head is broad.  Ears are
triangular and erect when alerted.  The muzzle is bulky, only slight
diminishing in width from root to nose.  The muzzle is not pointed or
long, yet not stubby.  The coat is thick with a coarse guard coat of
sufficient length to protect a woolly undercoat.  Malamutes are of
various colours.  Face markings are a distinguishing feature.  These
consist of a cap over the head, the face either all white or marked
with a bar and/or a mask.  The tail is well furred, carried over the
back, and has the appearance of a waving plume.  The Malamute
must be a heavy boned dog with sound legs, good feet, deep chest
and powerful shoulders, and have all of the other physical attributes
necessary for the efficient performance of his job.  The gait must be
steady, balanced, tireless and totally efficient.  He is not intended as
a racing sledge dog designed to compete in speed trials.  The
Malamute is structured for strength and endurance, and any
characteristic of the individual specimen, including temperament,
which interferes with the accomplishment of this purpose, is to be
considered the most serious of faults.

### IMPORTANT



### PROPORTIONS:


The
depth
of
chest
is
approximately one half the height of the dog at the shoulders, the
deepest point being just behind the forelegs.
The length of the body from point of shoulder to the rear point of
pelvis is longer than the height of the body from ground to top of the
withers.

BEHAVIOUR / TEMPERAMENT: The Alaskan Malamute is an
affectionate, friendly dog, not a « one-man » dog.  He is a loyal,
devoted companion, playful in invitation, but generally impressive
by his dignity after maturity.

HEAD: The head is broad and deep, not coarse or clumsy, but in
proportion to the size of the dog.  The expression is soft and indicates
an affectionate disposition.

### CRANIAL REGION:


Skull: Broad and moderately rounded between the ears, gradually
narrowing and flattening on top as it approaches the eyes, rounding
off to cheeks.  There is a slight furrow between the eyes.  The topline
of the skull and the topline of the muzzle show a slight break
downward from a straight line as they join.
Stop: Shallow.

### FACIAL REGION:


Nose: In all coat colours, except reds, the nose, lips, and eye rim
pigmentation is black.  Brown is permitted in red dogs.  The lighter
streaked « snow nose » is acceptable.
Muzzle: Large and bulky in proportion to the size of the skull,
diminishing slightly in width and depth from junction with the skull
to the nose.
Lips: Close fitting.
Jaws/Teeth: Broad with large teeth.  The incisors meet with a scissor
bite.  Overshot or undershot is a fault.
Cheeks: Moderately flat.

EYES: Obliquely placed in the skull.  Eyes are brown, almond
shaped and of medium size.  Blue eyes are a disqualifying fault.


FCI-St. N° 243 / 10.03.2023

EARS: Of medium size, but small in proportion to the head.  The
ears are triangular in shape and slightly rounded at tips.  They are set
wide apart on the outside back edges of the skull on line with the
upper corner of the eye, giving ears the appearance, when erect, of
standing off from the skull.  Erect ears point slightly forward, but
when the dog is at work, the ears are sometimes folded against the
skull.  High set ears are a fault.

NECK: Strong and moderately arched.

BODY: Compactly built but not short coupled.  The body carries no
excess weight, and bone is in proportion to size.
Back: Straight and gently sloping to the hips.
Loins: Hard and well muscled.  A long loin that may weaken the
back is a fault.
Chest: Well developed.

TAIL: Moderately set; follows the line of the spine at the base.
Carried over the back when not working.  It is not a snap tail or
curled tight against the back, nor is it short furred like a fox brush.
The Malamute tail is well furred and has the appearance of a waving
plume.

### LIMBS



### FOREQUARTERS:


General appearance: Forelegs heavily boned and muscled, straight to
the pasterns when viewed from the front.
Shoulder: Moderately sloping.
Pasterns: Short and strong and slightly sloping when viewed from the
side.
Forefeet: Of the « snowshoe » type, tight and deep, with wellcushioned pads, giving a firm, compact appearance.  The feet are
large, toes tight fitting and well arched.  There is a protective growth
of hair between the toes.  The pads are thick and tough; toenails short
and strong.



FCI-St. N° 243 / 10.03.2023

### HINDQUARTERS:


General appearance: The rear legs are broad.  When viewed from the
rear, the legs stand and move true in line with the movement of the
front legs, not too close or too wide.
Thighs: Heavily muscled.
Stifles: Moderately bent.
Hock joints:  Moderately bent and well let down.
Hind feet: Of the « snowshoe » type, tight and deep, with wellcushioned pads, giving a firm, compact appearance.  The feet are
large, toes tight fitting and well arched.  There is a protective growth
of hair between the toes.  The pads are thick and tough; toenails short
and strong.
Dewclaws on the rear legs are undesirable and should be removed
shortly after puppies are whelped.

GAIT/MOVEMENT: The gait of the Malamute is steady, balanced
and powerful.  He is agile for his size and build.  When viewed from
the side, the hindquarters exhibit strong rear drive that is transmitted
through a well-muscled loin to forequarters.  The forequarters
receive the drive from the rear with a smooth reaching stride.  When
viewed from the front or from the rear, the legs move true in line, not
too close or too wide.  At a fast trot, the feet will converge toward
the centerline of the body.  A stilted gait, or any gait that is not
completely efficient and tireless is to be penalized.

### COAT


Hair: The Malamute has a thick, coarse guard coat, never long and
soft.  The undercoat is dense, from one to two inches in depth, oily
and woolly.  The coarse guard coat varies in length as does the
undercoat.  The coat is relatively short to medium along the sides of
the body, with the length of the coat increasing around the shoulders
and neck, down the back, over the croup and in the breeching and
plume.  Malamutes usually have a shorter and less dense coat during
the summer months.  The Malamute is shown naturally.  Trimming is
not acceptable except to provide a clean-cut appearance of feet.




FCI-St. N° 243 / 10.03.2023

Colour: The usual colours range from light grey through intermediate
shadings to black, sable, and shading of sable to red.

Colour combinations are acceptable in undercoats, points and
trimmings.  The only solid colour allowable is all-white.  White is
always the predominant colour on underbody, parts of legs, feet, and
part of face markings.  A white blaze on the forehead and/or collar or
a spot on the nape is attractive and acceptable.  The Malamute is
mantled, and broken colours extending over the body or uneven
splashing are undesirable.

SIZE / WEIGHT: There is a natural range in size in the breed.  The
desirable freighting sizes are:
Males:
25 inches at the shoulders - 85 pounds (63,5 cm - 38 kg).
Females: 23 inches at the shoulders - 75 pounds (58,5 cm - 34 kg).
However, size consideration should not outweigh that of type,
proportion, movement and other functional attributes.  When dogs
are judged equal in type, proportion, movement, the dog nearest the
desirable freighting size is to be preferred.

### IMPORTANT SUMMARY:


In judging Alaskan Malamutes their function as a sledge dog for
heavy freighting in the Arctic must be given consideration above all
else.  The degree to which a dog is penalized should depend upon the
extent to which the dog deviates from the description of the ideal
Malamute and upon the extent to which the particular fault would
actually affect the working ability of the dog.  The legs of the
Malamute must indicate unusual strength and tremendous propelling
power.  Any indication of unsoundness in legs and feet, front or rear,
standing or moving, is to be considered a serious fault.  Faults under
this provision would be splay-footedness, cowhocks, bad pasterns,
straight shoulders, lack of angulation, stilted gait (or any gait that
isn’t balanced, strong and steady), ranginess, shallowness,
ponderousness, lightness of bone and poor overall proportion.




FCI-St. N° 243 / 10.03.2023


FAULTS: Any departure from the foregoing points should be
considered a fault and the seriousness with which the fault should be
regarded should be in exact proportion to its degree and its effect
upon the health and welfare of the dog.

### DISQUALIFYING FAULTS:


• Aggressive or overly shy dogs.
• Any dog clearly showing physical or behavioural abnormalities.
• Blue eyes.

### N.B.:


•
Male animals should have two apparently normal testicles fully
descended into the scrotum.
•
Only functionally and clinically healthy dogs, with breed
typical conformation should be used for breeding.
