FAULTS : Any departure from the foregoing points should be
considered a fault and the seriousness with which the fault should be
regarded should be in exact proportion to its degree and its effect
upon the health and welfare of the dog.

### DISQUALIFYING FAULTS:


• Aggressive or overly shy.
• Any dog clearly showing physical or behavioural abnormalities.
• Nasal bridge too short, too long or too slim.
• Pronounced overshot mouth; such a dog must be stristly
disqualified; however a dog with a slightly overshot mouth
(1/2 cm) has not to be eliminated.
• Black or red hair.

### N.B.:


• Male animals should have two apparently normal testicles fully

descended into the scrotum.
• Only functionally and clinically healthy dogs, with breed typical

conformation should be used for breeding.
