BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY:  At the beginning of the 20th
century, the English Toy Terrier was one of the most popular toy
dogs in Russia.  However, in the period 1920 – 1950 the breeding of
pure toy terriers was almost stopped and the number of dogs fell to a
critical level.  Only in the mid-fifties did Russian dog-breeders begin
the revival of the breed.  Practically all dogs which were used for
breeding had no pedigrees; many of them were not pure blood.  The
Standard drafted for Toy Terriers significantly differed from that of
the English Toy Terrier in many aspects.  From this moment, the
evolution of the breed in Russia went its own way.
On the 12th of October, 1958 two smooth-haired dogs, one of which
had slightly longer hair, gave birth to a male dog with a spectacular
fringes on ears and limbs.  It was decided to keep this feature. The
male was mated with a female which also had slightly long hair.
Thus the longhaired variety of the Russian Toy appeared.  It was
called Moscow Longhaired Toy Terrier.
A dog breeder from Moscow, Yevgueniya Fominichna Zharova,
played an important role in the creation of this breed variant.
It was during a long period of development, in an isolated context,
along with a specifically conducted selection that a new breed was
created: the Russian Toy with two coat varieties: longhaired and
smooth-haired.
