Even today with a minimum of training for maximum efficacity, it is
a good all-purpose working dog and a specialised guard of stock and
property.

With working trial.

BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: It has always  been called the
cowdog in the Belgian Ardennes and been selected for its abilities.  It
gets its name from the practice of guarding and driving cattle in the
region where it is active rather than from its physical appearance.
The harsh climate, the hard specific work, the difficult terrain and the
poverty of the region have all served to fashion its type.
Only the most hardy and the most hardworking of a deliberately
restricted population were retained to drive the herds, usually
consisting of milking cows and sheep but also pigs and horses in the
19th century.
From the 19th century they were used to track deer and wild boar,
and then during the two World Wars they became poachers’dogs.
At the end of the 19th century the drover’s dog looked like a sheep
dog with a harsh coat, but stronger, bigger and more biting.  In
Belgian shows classes were opened to drovers’ dogs as an
experiment to try to establish similarities of type.



St-FCI n°171/22.03.2002
On April 27th, 1903, at the Liege Show, Professor Reul discovered
Tom, the first example of the ideal type of drovers’dog. (no more
details provided at the time).
In 1913 « The Society of Liege for the improvement of the drovers’
dog from the province of Liege and the Ardennes » was founded and
it drew up a proposed standard.  The definitive text was adopted by
Belgium in 1923 and published by the FCI on June 16th, 1963.
The disappearance of many farms in the Ardennes plus the reduction
in milking herds considerably diminished the number of working
dogs.
In about 1985, the collection of colostrum from milking herds led
cynophiles to discover a few survivors of the Bouvier des Ardennes,
more or less typical of the breed.  By about 1990, some breeders set
out to produce dogs which corresponded better to the type laid down
in the standard and they began from these breeding lines in the
Ardennes.  Oddly enough, it was in the north of the country that a
few drovers and shepherds, astounded by the way that these dogs
drove herds, began a breeding programme, from a line transplanted
there about 1930 - a breeding programme which was out discreetly
but with care and confidence.  It was only in 1996 that this breed line
was discovered by the official cynophile authorities.



GENERAL APPEARANCE: It is a hardy strong dog of medium
size which makes no concessions to elegance.  It is short and thickset with a bone structure heavier than its size would suggest and a
powerful head.
The adjectives short, compact and well-muscled describe it best.  Its
harsch tousled coat (except on the head where it is shorter and flat),
its moustache and little beard all give a forbidding appearance.  The
Bouvier des Ardennes is to be judged in its natural stance, without
physical contact with the handler and without stacking.

### IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS:


• The length of the point of shoulder to the point of buttock is about
equal to the height at withers.
• The depth of the chest is about half the height at withers.



St-FCI n°171/22.03.2002
• The head is relatively short and the muzzle is definitely shorter
than the skull which is itself a little longer than broad.

BEHAVIOUR/TEMPERAMENT: The Bouvier des Ardennes is a
dog which shows much endurance and energy.  It is playful, curious,
agile and sociable and its main quality is its adaptability, so that it
feels at ease in every situation.  It is obstinate and extremely
courageous when it comes to defending its people, its belongings and
its territory.

HEAD: Strong, rather short.

CRANIAL REGION: Broad and flat, with an upper line parallel with
that of the muzzle.  Frontal groove and occipital crest are practically
invisible.  Superciliary ridges are emphasised by bushy eyebrows.
Cheek bones are neither prominent nor too arched.
Stop: Pronounced but not excessive.

### FACIAL REGION:


Nose: Broad, always black.
Muzzle: Broad, thick and well-filled-in under the eyes clearly shorter
than skull.  Furnished with upstanding hairs masking the internal
angle of the eye.  The sides of the muzzle and the cheeks form a
continuous line.
Lips: Thin, close-fitting, always with black edges.  The corner of the
mouth must not be slack.  Top and bottom lips, lower jaw and chin
are all furnished with hairs about 5-6 cm long forming a moustache
and little beard.
Jaws/Teeth: The jaws are powerful.  Dentition should be complete
according to the dental formula.  The absence of 2 premolars 1 (2
PM1) is acceptable and the molars 3 (M3) are not taken into
consideration.  The incisors in a scissor bite are set regularly in a
open arc.  The pincer bite with no lack of contact is accepted without
being favoured.  The mouth cavity must be as pigmented as possible.
Cheeks: Flat but well-muscled.



St-FCI n°171/22.03.2002
EYES: Medium size, not too wide apart, slightly oval, neither round
nor protruding, as dark as possible.  The lids are edged with black
and no haw should be visible.

EARS: Un-cropped.  Set high, triangular, rather small.  When
flattened, the tip should not reach further than the outer corner of the
eye.  Erect, straight pointed ears are preferred.  Straight ears with tips
falling forward or half-pricked ears, folded outwards are equally
acceptable.

NECK: Strong, well-muscled, with good reach, reasonably
cylindrical, slightly arched, carried sufficiently high, without dewlap.

BODY: Powerful but not heavy, ribs rounded rather than flat.
Length from point of shoulder to point of buttock is about the same
distance as height at withers.  Short-coupled.
Topline: Horizontal, broad, powerful and tight.
Withers: Slightly pronounced.
Back: Well-muscled and well-supported.  Supple without appearing
weak.
Loin: Short, broad, well-muscled, transversally quite flat.
Croup: Broad, slightly sloping but preferably horizontal.
Chest: Broad, descending to elbows, ribs well-sprung especially in
top third.  The underside of the chest should have a certain roundness
transversally.  Seen from the front of the chest is quite broad.
Underline: Belly quite full with little tuck-up.

TAIL: The majority are short-tailed with a good number born
tailless.  The tail is thick and set high.
Short tail: Follows the topline.
In countries where docking is prohibited, the tail should be left
natural.

### LIMBS



### FOREQUARTERS:


General appearance: Powerful bone.  The well-muscled front legs are
upright viewed from all angles and parallel seen from the front.
Shoulder: Reasonably long and oblique with thick muscle.  Shoulder
blade and upper arm form angle of about 110 degrees.
Upper arm: Long, well-muscled.
Elbow: Firm, neither set in nor out.
Forearm: Straight and strong.
Wrist (Carpus):  Firm and clearly defined, near the ground.
Pastern (Metacarpus): Strong, short and very slightly sloping.
Forefeet: Round, tight, arched toes, dark, thick elastic pads, strong
dark nails.

### HINDQUARTERS:


General appearance: Powerful, well-muscled, with reasonable
angulation, seen from rear parallel.  Standing in profile the foot must
be placed just behind the vertical line of the end of the ischium (point
of buttock).
Thighs: Very well-muscled and with prominent muscles.
Lower thigh: Reasonably long, very well-muscled.
Hock joint: Near the ground, broad and sinewy.
Rear Pastern (Metatarsus): Seen in profile, slightly sloping.  No dew
claws.
Hind feet: Like front feet.

GAIT/MOVEMENT: The limbs move in parallel lines, remaining
in line with the body and do not crab.  A fast free walk and a lively
trot are the usual gaits.  The Bouvier des Ardennes is not usually a
galloper but it can spin round instantly, whatever its speed or gait.
The trot covers the ground well with a regular gait and an excellent
rear thrust, with the topline retained well on the move.  The dog
should not amble.  Because it is an active dog, the Bouvier des
Ardennes rarely remains still.  When off the lead, its ability to drive
herds means that it often follows its owner, making sweeping semicircles.



St-FCI n°171/22.03.2002

SKIN: Tight fitting, without wrinkles, but supple.  The edges of
eyelids and lips are always well-pigmented.

### COAT


Hair: The coat must allow the dog to live outside, to guard and drive
herds, however extreme its local atmospheric conditions may be.
The topcoat must be dry, coarse and tousled, about 6 cm long over
all the body but shorter and flatter on the skull, even with the
presence of eyebrows.  The hair must form a moustache and a little
beard about 5-6 cm long and hide the internal corner of eye.  The
forearms are covered by shorter dry hair, a little shaggy, giving them
a somewhat cylindrical aspect with the addition of short fringes on
the back of the limbs.  The back of the thighs has longer hair making
the breeches.  The outer side of the ears is covered with soft straight
short hair with occasional longer hairs.  The auditory canal is
protected by longer hairs which blend with those from the collar
effect of backward sloping hairs around the neck.  The spaces
between the pads are filled with very short hairs.
The undercoat is very dense whatever the season and even more
abundant in winter, protecting the dog from extremes of weather.  It
is also present on the limbs.  Its length is about half that of the top
coat.

Colour: All colours are acceptable except white and the colour of the
undercoat varies according to the shade of the top coat.  A white
mark on the chest or the tips of the toes is acceptable without being
sought after.  The coat is often formed from a mixture of grey, black
and fawn hairs; a grey coat going from pale grey to dark grey; a
brownish, red or straw coloured coat.
