BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: In 19th-century Picardy,
various authors described, in their writings, some black or black
and white spaniels called “épagneuls du Nord” (“Spaniels of the
North”). It was only from the early 20th century that the Blue
Picardy Spaniel started running in a specific category until it
became officially recognised as a breed. When the standard was
officially registered in 1938, the general appearance and abilities
of the Blue Picardy Spaniel were described in the following
terms: “Quite low to the ground dog, well built for the job”. The
main difference between the Blue Picardy Spaniel and the
Spaniel of Picardy (the two PICARDY breeds) is the colour of
their coat.
A contact dog for chases within firing range, the Blue Picardy
Spaniel adapts to all sorts of small game hunts and is
particularly skilled in woodcock hunting.
A daily walk is necessary to keep him fit and help him relax. He
will always find his way to a happy cuddle. Out on a walk, his
elegant, characteristic bluish coat will not go unnoticed.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: Dog of medium proportions and a
Continental spaniel-type (“Braque” in French) with flat, slightly
wavy hair. The singularity and elegance of the Blue Picardy


FCI-St. N° 106 / 10.08.2023
Spaniel stem from the typical colour of his coat. Quite low to the
ground dog, well built for the job. General appearance on the whole:
a true French Spaniel.

IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS: The length between the tip of
the shoulder and the ischium exceeds by roughly 1/10th the height
at the withers. Chest well developed and let down to the elbows.
Length of the muzzle should be equal to that of the skull.

BEHAVIOUR / TEMPERAMENT: Flexible and gentle dog with
an even temperament, well adapted to family life; should come
out as placid and never aggressive. An athletic dog, the Blue
Picardy Spaniel enjoys a daily walk to work off his energy.

between them. The upper longitudinal axes of the skull and
muzzle are parallel or slightly convergent.

Height at the withers: 57 to 62 cm for the males
55 to 60 cm for the females.
A tolerance of ± 2 cm is permitted yet undesirable.
