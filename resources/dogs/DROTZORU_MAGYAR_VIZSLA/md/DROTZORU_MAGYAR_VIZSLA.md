ORIGIN: Hungary.

### DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THE OFFICIAL VALID



### STANDARD: 06.04.2000.



UTILISATION: A versatile gun dog that must be able to work in
the field, forest and water, having the following typical qualities: an
excellent nose, firmness on the point, excellent retrieves and
determination to remain on the scent even when swimming, which he
manifestly enjoys. He copes with difficult terrain as well as extreme
weather conditions.  As he is intended to be an efficient hunting dog,
gun and game shyness, unwillingness to point and retrieve, as well as
a dislike of water are undesirable. Because of his easy going nature
and his adaptability, he can easily be kept as a companion dog in the
house.

FCI-CLASSIFICATION:  Group


## 7  Pointing Dogs.



Section  1 Continental Pointing Dogs.



With working trial (Field and Water



Trial)

BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: The Hungarian Wire-Haired
Vizsla was created by cross-breeding the Hungarian Short-Haired
Vizsla with the German Wire-Haired Pointer during the 1930‘s. His
breed characteristics are identical with those of the Hungarian ShortHaired Vizsla.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: A lively, russet gold hunting dog of
dry and lean but more robust construction compared to the
Hungarian Short-Haired Vizsla.
His appearance embodies his qualities as a multi-purpose pointing
dog, endurance, working ability and an easily satisfied nature.



FCI-St. N° 239 / 13.09.2000

### IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS:


•
The body length slightly exceeds the height at the withers.
•
The depth of the brisket is slightly less than half the height at the
withers.
•
The muzzle is slightly shorter than half the length of the head.

BEHAVIOUR/TEMPERAMENT: An affectionate and intelligent
dog, self-confident, easily trained, which cannot bear rough
treatment.  He keeps contact with his handler, is passionate in his
quest, is stubborn, has a good nose and is staunch on the point.

### HEAD



### CRANIAL REGION:



Skull: Moderately wide, slightly domed. A slightly pronounced
groove runs from the moderately developed occiput towards the stop.
The superciliary ridges are moderately developed.
Stop: Moderate.

### FACIAL REGION:



Nose: Broad and well developed with nostrils as wide as possible.
The colour of the nose harmonises in a dark shading with the coat
colour.
Muzzle: Blunt, not pointed, with powerful jaws, strongly muscled.
The bridge of the nose is straight
Lips: Tightly fitting, no pendulous flews.
Jaws/Teeth: Powerful jaws with a perfect, regular and complete
scissors bite, the upper teeth closely overlapping the lower teeth and
set square to the jaws; with 42 healthy teeth according to the
dentition formula.
Cheeks: Strong, well muscled.

EYES: Slightly oval, of medium size, well fitting eyelids. Intelligent
and lively expression. The brown eye colour harmonising with the
coat colour, as dark as possible preferred.



FCI-St. N° 239 / 13.09.2000
EARS: Leathers set on at medium height, a little backwards, hanging
closely to the cheeks, ending in a rounded V shape. Slightly shorter
than those of the Hungarian Short-Haired Vizsla.

NECK: Of medium length, harmonising with the overall appearance.
The nape very muscular and slightly arched. Tightly fitting skin at
the throat.

### BODY:


Withers: Pronounced and muscular.
Back: Solid, well muscled, taut and straight. The vertebral spines
should be hidden by the muscles.
Loin: Short, broad, tight, muscular, straight or slightly arched. The
loin is well attached.
Croup: Broad and of sufficient length, not cut off short, sloping
slightly to the tail. Well muscled.
Chest:
Deep and broad with well developed well muscled and
moderately arched forechest, sternum extending as well back as
possible. The sternum and the elbows should be at the same level.
Last ribs moderately arched. Ribs carried well back.
Underline and belly: Elegant, tight, arching towards the rear, slightly
tucked up.

TAIL: Set on at medium height, strong at the base, then tapering. In
countries where tail docking is not prohibited by law, the tail may be
shortened by one quarter to avoid hunting hazards. If the tail docking
is prohibited, the tail reaches down to the hock joint and is carried
straight or slightly sabre like. On the move, it is raised up to the
horizontal. The tail is well furnished with dense coat.

### LIMBS



### FOREQUARTERS:


General appearance: Viewed from the front, straight and parallel.
Viewed from the side, legs vertical and placed well under the body.
Good bone, well muscled.
Shoulders: Long, sloping and flat, well attached shoulder blade.
Elastic when moving. Strong, dry muscles. Well angulated between
shoulder blade and upper arm.


FCI-St. N° 239 / 13.09.2000
Upper arm: As long as possible, well muscled.
Elbows: Close to the body, however not tied in, turning neither in nor
out. Well angulated between upper arm and forearm.
Forearm: Long, straight, sufficiently muscled. Bones strong, but not
coarse.
Pastern joint: Dry, sinewy.
Pastern: Short. Only very slightly sloping.
Forefeet: Slightly oval, with well knit, sufficiently arched, strong
toes. Strong brown nails. Tough, resistant, slate grey pads. The feet
are parallel when standing or moving.

### HINDQUARTERS:


General appearance: Viewed from behind, straight and parallel.
Good angulations. Strong bone.
Upper thigh: Long and muscular. Good angulation between pelvis
and upper thigh.
Stifle: Well angulated.
Lower thigh: Long, muscular and sinewy. Its length is almost equal
to that of the upper thigh. Good angulation between lower thigh and
metatarsus.
Hock joint: Strong, dry and sinewy, rather well let down.
Metatarsus: Vertical, short and strong.
Hind feet: Similar to forefeet.

GAIT/MOVEMENT: The typical gait is an animated, light-footed
trot, elegant and far reaching, with much drive and corresponding
reach. Not exhausting gallop when working in the field. The back is
firm and the topline remains level. Pacing is undesirable.

SKIN: Tightly fitting, without folds. The skin is well pigmented.

### COAT


Hair: Wiry, close lying, strong, dense and not glossy. Length of outer
coat 2-3 cm; dense, water repellent undercoat. The outline of the
body must not be hidden by the longer coat.




FCI-St. N° 239 / 13.09.2000
By its hardness and density, it should provide as much protection as
possible against weather conditions and injuries. The lower parts of
the legs as well as the undersides of chest and belly should be
covered with shorter, softer and slightly thinner hair; the coat on the
head and on the leathers is shorter and, at the same time, a little
darker, however, not soft and dense.
Pronounced eyebrows accentuate the stop. These and a strong, not
too long (2-3 cm), as harsh as possible beard, on both sides of the
muzzle, underline the determined expression. On both sides of the
neck the coat forms V-shaped brushes.

Colour: Various shades of russet gold and dark sandy gold
(semmelgelb). The leathers may be a little darker, otherwise uniform
in colour. Red, brownish, light yellow or lightened colour shadings
are undesirable. A little white patch on the chest or at the throat, not
more than 5 cm in diameter, as well as white markings on the toes,
are not considered faulty. The colour of the lips and of the eye rims
corresponds to the colour of the nose.

### SIZE/WEIGHT:



### HEIGHT AT WITHERS:



Dogs:
58 - 64 cm
Bitches:
54 - 60 cm

It is ineffective to increase the height at the withers. A medium size
should be aimed at. Overall balance and symmetry are much more
important than the mere measurable size.


FAULTS: Any departure from the foregoing points should be
considered a fault and the seriousness with which the fault should be
regarded should be in exact proportions to its degree and its effect
upon the health and welfare of the dog.



FCI-St. N° 239 / 13.09.2000
