BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: The Norwich and Norfolk
Terrier take their names, obviously, from the county and the city,
though turning the clock back to the early and mid-1800s there
was no such distinction, this being just a general farm dog. Glen
of Imaals, red Cairn Terriers and Dandie Dinmonts are among the
breeds behind these East Anglian terriers and from the resultant
red progeny emerged the present Norwich and Norfolk Terrier.
A typical short-legged terrier with a sound, compact body which
has been used not only on fox and badger, but on rats as well. He
has a delightful disposition, is totally fearless but is not one to
start a fight. As a worker he does not give up in the face of a
fierce adversary underground, and his standard’s reference to the
acceptability of ‘honourable scars from fair wear and tear’ is a
good indication of the type of dog.
The Norwich Terrier was accepted on the Kennel Club Breed
Register in 1932, and were known as the drop-eared Norwich Terrier
(now known as the Norfolk Terrier) and prick-eared Norwich
Terrier. The breeds were separated in 1964 and the drop-eared
variety gained the name Norfolk Terrier.


GENERAL APPEARANCE: One of the smallest of the terriers.
Low, keen dog, compact and strong with good substance and bone.
Honourable scars from fair wear and tear not to be unduly penalised.
