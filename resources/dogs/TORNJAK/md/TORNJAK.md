### BRIEF



### HISTORICAL



### SUMMARY:


The
almost
extinct
descendants of genetically homogeneous, native archaic types of
shepherd dogs have been the foundation stock for the re-creation of
the breed “Tornjak”.  The dogs belonging to the original stock had
been dispersed in mountain areas of Bosnia and Herzegovina and
Croatia and their surrounding valleys.
The major historical dates are the years 1067 and 1374. Written
documents from these periods mention the Bosnian-HerzegovinianCroatian breed for the first time.
The research about their historical and more recent existence and
then a systematic salvation from extinction started simultaneously in
Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina around 1972 and continuous
pure blood breeding began in 1978. Nowadays, the breed population
consists of numerous, purebred dogs selected during a series of
generations dispersed throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina and
Croatia.

forehead, up to the imaginary line connecting the ears, over the ears
and on the front parts of legs and feet it is short. It is especially
abundant around the neck (mane), dense and long over the upper
thighs (breeches). It forms feathers along the forearms.  With well
coated dogs it is also especially abundant on the rear of hind
pasterns. The tail is richly coated with very long hair.  Winter
undercoat is long, very thick and of nice woolly texture. Hair is thick
and dense and should not part along the back.
