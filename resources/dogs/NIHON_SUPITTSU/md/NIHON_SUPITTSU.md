BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY : The origin of the Japanese
Spitz is said to be the large-sized white German Spitz brought to
Japan around 1920 via the continent of Siberia and northeast part of
China.  Around the year 1921 the breed was first exhibited at a dog
show in Tokyo.
Subsequently, in 1925, two pairs of white Spitz were imported from
Canada, and until around 1936, imports came from Canada, the U.S.,
Australia and China.  Eventually their offspring were crossbred to
produce a better breed.  After the 2nd World War, the unified breed
standard was established by the Japan Kennel Club in 1948 to be
valid to the present.
