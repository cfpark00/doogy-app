### STANDARD: 08.06.2023.



UTILIZATION: Pointing dog.

### FCI-CLASSIFICATION:


Group 7
Pointing Dogs.

Section 1.2 Continental
Pointing



Dogs, Spaniel type.

With working trial.

BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: The diverse biotope of the
Picardy region led local hunters to look for a sturdy, versatile
and generous dog.
This ancient breed has mainly been used locally, which explains
why it has never quite expanded outside of Picardy.
And yet, going on a hunt with him is utterly delightful! His
ability at work is legendary. Both firm and cheerful while
pointing, with a keen sense of smell that leaves no chance to his
prey.
The main difference between the Blue Picardy Spaniel and the
Spaniel of Picardy (the two PICARDY breeds) is the colour of
the coat.
The breed has gained some renewed interest, with many hunters
happily rediscovering this long-neglected ally, the perfect match
for those seeking an auxiliary adapted to small game hunting…
His kindness also makes him an ideal companion at home. A real
kid lover, he will happily join in their games without ever
outplaying them.

with tan and white” resulting in a coat traditionally called
“autumn leaves”).

Females: 55 to 60 cm
A tolerance of ± 2 cm is permitted yet undesirable.


FCI-St. N° 108 / 24.08.2023
