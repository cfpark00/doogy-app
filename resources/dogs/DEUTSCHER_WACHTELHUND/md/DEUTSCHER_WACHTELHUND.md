Flushing Dogs.

With working trial.

BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: From hunting literature, it can
be proved that hunting dogs resembling the present day Wachtelhund
have existed for centuries and have been used for flushing game.
The term « Wachtelhund » also has historic origins.
Breeding of the German Spaniel, according to a stud book, began at
the turn of the century.
The progenitor of the breed was « Lord Augusta 1834 L », who came
from Staufenberg (Upper Bavaria).  Pure breeding began with a few
suitable bitches.  At first only brown dogs (sometimes with white
markings), and white-brown dogs were bred, the latter occasionally
with small tan (red) markings on head and legs, the so-called
« Brand ».  Through the bitch, « Baby auf der Schanze 1838 L », the
brown roan colour occurred in the breed.
Rudolf Friess (R.F.), who influenced the breeding of the German
Spaniel for decades, introduced the separate colour breeding for
browns and roans.  By carefully planned matings within both colour
strains he succeded to establish the important precondition - in spite
of the small gene pool - to keep away from the damages through
inbreeding.
The separation of the colour strains seemed also sensible in view of
the somewhat different dispositions of the dogs.
The browns as short distance hunters, easier to make them hunt the
game towards the guns, the brown roan colour as long distance
hunters, especially willing to follow a trail.


FCI-St. N° 104  / 12.03.1999
The difference in disposition can nowadays no longer be regarded as
a valid distinction between the two strains, as in the meantime, for
various reasons, numerous matings between the two strains had taken
place.  Generally, however, the separation still counts today as a
preservation of an unrelated reservoir of blood within the breed.
The German Spaniel was and is still bred exclusively by hunters for
hunters as a flushing and versatile hunting dog.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: The German Spaniel is a medium
sized, long-haired, very muscular flushing dog with noble head and
strong bone.  Altogether longer than high, but never looking high on
leg.

### IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS:


Relation to body length to height at withers: 1,2 to 1.
Relation to depth of chest to height at withers: 0,5 to 1.
Relation of muzzle to cranial region: 1 to 1.

BEHAVIOUR / TEMPERAMENT: Lively, passionate hunter,
friendly, assured, very docile and adaptable, neither nervous nor
aggressive.
Characteristics of the German Spaniel are:
• Possessed of a strong desire to find.
• Able to pick up scent, firm in tracking.
• Reliable at giving tongue.
• A fine nose.
• Likes retrieving and work in water.
• Sharp with game and vermin.
• Working independently but still in a controlled manner when
appropriately trained and guided; reliable for tracking wounded
game, retrieving lost game and flushing; a versatile gundog
especially for woodland with heavy cover and water.
The trait to point was not given attention since breeding began.

### HEAD



### CRANIAL REGION:


Skull: Flat, moderately broad, no marked occiput.
Stop: Only moderately developed.

### FACIAL REGION:


Nose: Nose leather large and dark with wide open nostrils.
Depigmented patches are a fault.  Roman nose embellishes the dog.
Muzzle: Strong with nasal bridge remaining evenly broad, slightly
rounded towards the end.  On no account pointed, not shorter than
cranial region.
Lips: Straight, dry, taut.  Pigment according to coat colour.
Jaws/Teeth: Complete set of 42 teeth in the following order seen
diagrammatically from the front:


### Right

Upper jaw

### Lower jaw

Lower jaw
Definition of above tooth formation: I = Incisor, C = Canine, P =
Premolar, M = Molar.
Incisors in upper jaw close in incisor bite in front of those in lower
jaw.  Pincer bite will be tolerated.  Teeth well developed, strong.
Cheeks: Dry, skin taut, cheek bones not protruding.

EYES: Medium brown, as dark as possible.  Medium size, set in
slightly oblique, neither protruding nor deep set with tight fitting lids,
not showing any haw.  Hair on rims of eyelids.

EARS: Leathers set on high and broad, flat without any twist,
hanging directly behind eye.  Not thick, fleshy or flabby.  Evenly
furnished with hair reaching over inner edge.  Laid forward, leathers
reach nose leather.

NECK: Strong, nape of neck specially well muscled.  Merging with
withers in a blunt angle.  No visible throatiness at beginning and
widening towards chest without dewlap.


FCI-St. N° 104  / 12.03.1999


### BODY:


Upper line: Straight in the different parts of the body, merging well
into each other.  Croup slightly sloping, tail in continuation with
topline or carried slightly downwards.
Withers:  Strong and well defined.
Back: Short and firm, without any dip behind withers.
Loin:  Strongly muscled, therefore broad in appearance.
Croup: Slightly sloping, never overbuilt.  Slightly below height of
withers.
Chest: Oval, seen from front.  Seen from side, reaching to below
elbow joint.  Ribcage long, well sprung, neither barrel shaped nor
flat.
Lower line and belly: Tucked up moderately from last (false) rib to
rear.  Underside also covered as much as possible by protective hair
and undercoat.

TAIL: In repose, carried straight in continuation of topline or
downwards.  When alert or excited, carried slightly upwards and
wagging vividly.  To avoid injury, the tail should be shortened
(docked) by not more than a third during the first three days after
birth.  In countries where docking is not permitted, the tail can be left
natural.

### COAT


Hair: Strong, close fitting, mostly wavy, sometimes curly (astrakhan)
or smooth long coat, with thick undercoat.  Hair not too long, much
less thin or even silky.  On nape, leathers and croup, often curly.
Rearside of legs and tail, well feathered.  Frequently frill on neck
(jabot).  Also well coated on belly.
Muzzle and cranial region: Hair short but dense.  The leathers are
covered by curls or dense wavy hair which also reaches beyond their
inner edge.  Interdigital gaps have dense but not too long hair.

Colour: The German Spaniel is bred in two colour varieties:
• Solid brown, and more seldom also red*, including all occurring
reddish shades (like fox or deer red).  Also, often with white or
ticked markings on chest and toes.
• Brown roan, more seldom red* roan.  As basic colour, brown or
red* hair is closely mixed with white hair.  Often with the head
brown or red*, as well as with patches or a saddle over the whole
back.



FCI-St. N° 104  / 12.03.1999
To this colour variety also belong the pied colour patterns with
white as basic colour and large brown or red* patches as well as
« tiger » pattern where the white basic colour is in addition
sprinkled or ticked with clusters of brown or red* hair, even when
bred from solid colour parents.  In both colours, red* markings
(« Brand ») over eyes, on muzzle, legs and round vent can occur.
* Red = all existing reddish shades (fox, roedeer or deer red).

### SIZE AND WEIGHT:


Height at the withers: Dogs:
48 to 54 cm,

Bitches:  45 to 52 cm.
Weight: Varying, according to size, between 18 to 25 kg.  Bitches
are slightly lighter than dogs.

FAULTS : Any departure from the foregoing points should be
considered a fault and the seriousness with which the fault should be
regarded should be in exact proportion to its degree and its effect
upon the health and welfare of the dog.
• Marked stop.
• Missing of a first premolar (PM1).
• Too deep flews, lips not enough taut.
• Eyelids not close fitting.
• Too narrow ear channels (disposition for ear trouble).
• Barrel chest.
• High on leg or fine bone.
• Thin, sparse or silky coat; sparsely coated belly.  Ear ends
leathery.
• Slightly over or under in size or weight.

### SEVERE FAULTS:


• Skins problems: Dermatitis, atopy.
• Missing teeth, apart from the lack of one PM1.




FCI-St. N° 104  / 12.03.1999


### DISQUALIFYING FAULTS:

•
Any dog clearly showing physical or behavioural abnormalities.
• Weak temperament, gun-or game-shy.
• Serious mouth faults (over-or undershot, wry mouth).
• Entropion, ectropion.

### N.B.:


• Male animals should have two apparently normal testicles fully
descended into the scrotum.
