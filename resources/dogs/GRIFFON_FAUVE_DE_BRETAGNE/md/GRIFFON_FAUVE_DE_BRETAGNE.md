### FCI- CLASSIFICATION:


Group   6  Scent

Section 1.2 Medium-sized hounds
With working trial

BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: The fauve de Bretagne is one
of the oldest French scent hound breeds and as early as the XIV
century a gentleman by the name of Huet des Ventes had a pack of
these dogs. Much used until the XIX century for wolf hunting in
Brittany, it suffered a decline when these animals disappeared.
Striving to maintain the quality of these hounds, which had become
rare, Marcel Pambrun founded the Club de Fauve de Bretagne in


## 1949. Since the 1980’s, under the direction of Bernard Vallée, the


griffon fauve de Bretagne (as well as the derived breed, the basset
fauve de Bretagne) has established a place among the French scent
hound breeds. The motto “hunting first” continues to guide the club’s
conduct.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: A bony and muscular dog, very
resistant to weather and fatigue. A quite active hound, particularly
suitable to difficult terrain. It has good scenting ability and the
sustained voice of a “chopper” (short and repeated notes).

BEHAVIOUR / TEMPERAMENT: Fauves de Bretagne are
impassioned hunters but are good natured with people, sociable,
affectionate and equable.


FCI-St. N° 66  /  05.05.2003
They adapt themselves easily to all terrains and to all quarry. When
hunting they reveal themselves to be courageous, wily, tenacious and
steady. They are enterprising and efficient but show themselves
equally capable of harking in. When well conducted, they are
obedient and return readily.

### HEAD



### CRANIAL REGION:


Skull: Rather long, marked occipital protuberance. Seen from the
front, the cranium has the form of a flattened arch and diminishes in
width from the rear to the superciliary arches, which are not very
prominent.
Stop: Only slightly marked.

### FACIAL REGION:


Nose: Black or dark brown; well-open nostrils.
Muzzle: Slightly tapering rather than being perfectly rectangular.
Lips: Covering well the lower jaw but without excess. Moustaches
only slightly furnished.
Jaws/Teeth: The jaws and teeth are strong, meeting in a perfect and
even scissors bite. The upper incisors cover the lower in close
contact. The incisors are set square to the jaws.  Absence of first
premolars is not penalized.

EYES: Neither bulging nor set too deeply in the orbits, dark brown
in colour. The conjunctiva is not apparent. The expression is lively.

EARS: Finely attached, in line with the eye, just reaching the end of
the nose when drawn forward, ending in a point, turned inwards and
covered by finer and shorter hair than on the rest of the body.

NECK: Rather short and well muscled.

### BODY


Back: Short and broad. Never swaybacked.
Loin: Broad and muscular.
Chest: Deep and broad.


FCI-St. N° 66  /  05.05.2003
Ribs: Rather rounded.

Underline and belly: The underline rises only slightly towards the
rear.

48 cm minimum (19”)
56 cm maximum (22”)
with a tolerance of 2 cm (0.8”) for
