FCI-St. N° 160  / 02.04.2001

COUNTRY OF ORIGIN: Ireland.

### DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THE ORIGINAL VALID



### STANDARD: 13.03.2001.



UTILIZATION:  Up to the end of the17th century, Irish
Wolfhounds were used for hunting wolves and deer in Ireland. They
were also used for hunting the wolves that infested large areas of
Europe before the forests were cleared.

CLASSIFICATIONS FCI:  Group  10 Sighthounds.



Section  2 Rough-haired Sighthounds.

Without working trial.


BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: We know the continental
Celts kept a greyhound probably descended from the greyhound first
depicted in Egyptian paintings.  Like their continental cousins, the
Irish Celts were interested in breeding large hounds. These large
Irish hounds could have had smooth or rough coats, but in later
times, the rough coat predominated possibly because of the Irish
climate.  The first written account of these dogs was by a Roman
Consul 391 A.D. but they were already established in Ireland in the
first century A.D. when Setanta changed his name to Cu-Chulainn
(the hound of Culann).  Mention is made of the Uisneach (1st
century) taking 150 hounds with them in their flight to Scotland.
Irish hounds undoubtedly formed the basis of the Scottish
Deerhound.  Pairs of Irish hounds were prized as gifts by the Royal
houses of Europe, Scandinavia and elsewhere from the Middle ages
to the 17th century.  They were sent to England, Spain, France,
Sweden, Denmark, Persia, India and Poland. In the15th century each
county in Ireland was required to keep 24 wolfdogs to protect
farmers' flocks from the ravages of wolves.  The Cromwellian
prohibition (1652) on the export of Wolfhounds helped preserve their
number for a time but the gradual disappearance of the wolf and
continued demand abroad reduced their numbers almost to the point
of extinction by the end of the 17th century.



FCI-St. N° 160  / 02.04.2001
The revival of interest in the breed accompanied the growth of Irish
nationalism in the late 19th century.  The Irish Wolfhound became a
living symbol of Irish culture and of the Celtic past.  At this time,
one determined enthusiast, Capt. G A  Graham, set about obtaining
some of the few remaining hounds of the Wolfhound type that could
still be found in Ireland, and with the use of Deerhound blood and
the occasional outcross of Borzoi and Great Dane, he eventually
achieved a type of dog that bred true in every generation.  The results
were ultimately accepted as a legitimate revival of the breed.  The
Irish Kennel Club scheduled a class for Irish Wolfhounds at their
show in April 1879, and a club was formed in 1885.  The Irish
Wolfhound now enjoys once again something of the reputation that it
had in the Middle Ages.  Wolfhounds are now owned and bred in
fairly large numbers outside of Ireland.

GENERAL APPEARANCE:  The Irish Wolfhound should not be
quite so heavy or massive as the Great Dane, but more so than the
Deerhound, which in general type he should otherwise resemble.  Of
great size and commanding appearance, very muscular, strongly
though gracefully built, movements easy and active; head and neck
carried high; the tail carried with an upward sweep with a slight
curve towards the extremity.
Great size, including height at shoulder and proportionate length of
body, is the desideratum to be aimed at, and it is desired to firmly
establish a race that shall average 32 inches (81cm) to 34 inches
(86cm) in dogs, showing the requisite power, activity, courage and
symmetry.

BEHAVIOUR AND TEMPERAMENT: “Lambs at home, lions
in the chase”.

HEAD:  Long and level, carried high; the frontal bones of the
forehead very slightly raised and very little indentation between the
eyes.
