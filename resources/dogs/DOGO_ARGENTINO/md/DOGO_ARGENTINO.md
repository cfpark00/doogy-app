Without working trial.


BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: This breed is native to the
province of  Cordoba, in the Mediterranean region of Argentina.
Its creator was Dr. Antonio Nores Martinez, a prominent and active
surgeon (1907 – 1956).
His work was based upon the methodical crossbreeding of the “Old
Fighting Dog of Cordoba”, a breed of great power and strength,
which was the product of crossbreeding among dog of the breeds
Bulldogs and Bull Terriers.
He selected completely white dogs for breeding, not undershot, with
heavy heads and long muzzle.
After a thorough and minute character study and selection, through
different generations, his aim was accomplished forming different
families always using as a start the Old Fighting Dog of Cordoba
which was crossed at first with English Bull Dog, Great Dane,
Pyrenean Mastiff, Bull Terrier, Boxer, Pointer, Dogue de Bordeaux
and Irish Wolfhound.
In 1947 the breed was already created and its genotype and
phenotype were stabilized. The same year the breed standard was
presented at the Hunter’s Club in the City of Buenos Aires.



FCI-St. N°292 / 02.08.2012

Its strength, tenacity, sense of smell and bravery make it the best in
the pack of dogs to hunt wild boars, peccaries, pumas and other
predators of agriculture and livestock that inhabit the vast and
diverse regions of Argentina. This is the traditional activity for which
Antonio Nores created this breed.
In 1964 it was recognized as a breed by the FCA (Federación
Cinologica Argentina) and the Sociedad Rural Argentina, which
opened their studbook to initiate registry.
Just in 1973 the breed was accepted by the FCI. This was possible
thanks to the great passion and unique work and effort of Dr. Agustín
Nores Martínez, brother of the founder of the breed, who achieved
this recognition not only because of his individual actions but also
from the institutional action of the FCA and the Dogo Argentino
Club “Dr. Antonio Nores Martinez”.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: It is an athletic dog, mesomorphic,
normal type, of harmonious proportions. With powerful muscles and
agile, his appearance gives the impression of power, energy and
strength, in contrast to its expression of friendship and gentleness.
All-white; can have a single dark spot on the skull.

IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS: Mesocephalic, the muzzle should
be the same length as the skull.
The height at the withers should be slightly greater than the height at
the croup.
Depth of chest should represent at least 50% of the height at the
withers.
The length of the body should exceed the height at the withers by
only 10% (maximum).

BEHAVIOUR AND TEMPERAMENT: It should be silent, never
barking on the trail, with a keen nose and excellent flair, vent, agile,
strong, robust and especially brave.
Should never be aggressive toward humans, a feature that will be
severely observed. It must give you love without conditions or
reservations.



FCI-St. N°292 / 02.08.2012

HEAD: Of mesocephalic type, it looks strong and powerful.
The cranio-facial axes are convergent.

### CRANIAL REGION:


Skull: Compact, convex seen in profile and from the front due to the
outline of the well developed masticatory and neck muscles.
Occiput: Occipital protuberance not visible due to powerful muscles
of neck which hide it completely.
Stop: Defined but should not be deep or have sharp/abrupt angles.

FACIAL REGION: As long as the skull, the line joining the two
frontal orbital muscles is equidistant from the occiput and the
mandibular joint of the upper jaws.
Nose: Strongly Black pigmented. Nostrils well opened.
Muzzle: Same length as the skull, with concave top line.
Lips: Tight, free edges, black pigmented, never pendulous.
Jaws/Teeth: Jaws correctly positioned, well-developed and strong,
With no under or overshot, with healthy teeth, large and with normal
implant. Full dentition is recommended.  Scissor bite, pincer bite is
accepted.
Cheeks: Large, marked, covered by strong skin, without folds. Welldeveloped masseter muscles.

EYES: Medium size, almond shaped, dark or hazel coloured, lids
preferably with black pigmentation. Sub-frontal position, wide apart,
lively and intelligent expression but at the same time remarkably
firm.

EARS: Set high, lateral, well apart due to the width of the skull.
Functionally, they should be cropped and erect, in triangular shape
and with a length that should not exceed 50% of the front edge of the
auricle of the natural ear.  Without being cropped, they are of
medium length, broad, thick, flat and rounded at the tip.
Covered with smooth hair which is slightly shorter than on the rest of
the body; they can have small spots, not to be penalized.



FCI-St. N°292 / 02.08.2012

In natural position they hang down covering the back of the cheeks.
When the dog is alert, they may be carried semi-erect.

NECK: Thick, arched, the skin of the throat is very thick forming
smooth folds without forming dewlap. The elasticity of the skin is
due to the cellular tissue being very lax.

BODY: Rectangular. The length of the body (measured from the
point of shoulder to point of buttock) may exceed the height at the
withers by only 10%.
Top line: Higher at the withers, sloping gently to the croup. The
adults have a median furrow along the spine caused by the
prominence of the spinal muscles. See from the side should not have
any depression.
Withers: Strong, well defined and high.
Back: Very strong, with muscles well defined.
Loins: Short, broad, very muscular.
Croup: Broad and strong. Moderately inclined.
Chest: Broad and deep. Seen from the front and profile, the sternum
must reach down to the level of the elbows, thereby giving maximum
breathing capacity. The thorax is long with ribs moderately curved.
Underline and Belly: Rising slightly on the bottom line of the chest,
never tucked up, strong and with good muscle tension.

TAIL: Long, not to exceed the hock joint, thick medium set. At rest
it hangs down naturally, in action it is raised in an arc with an ample
curve.

all of its energy, fully displaying its power.  The movement is agile
and firm when walking, trotting or galloping. Should be harmonious
and balanced showing a solid body construction. Ambling (pacing) is
not accepted and is considered a serious fault.
