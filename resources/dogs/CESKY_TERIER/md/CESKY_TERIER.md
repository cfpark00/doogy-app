CLASSIFICATION FCI:  Group

BRIEF HISTORICAL  SUMMARY: The  Czech Terrier  is the
result of  an appropriate crossbreeding between a  Sealyham Terrier
dog and a Scotch Terrier bitch,  with the  aim to develop  a light,
short legged,  well pigmented hunting Terrier, with practical drop
ears, easy to groom and easy to train.  In 1949 Mr. Frantisek Hork
from Kl novice near Prague started to improve the breed by fixing
their characteristics.  In 1959 these dogs were shown for the first
time, and the breed was finally recognized by the FCI in 1963.

and well muscled Terrier with smallish drop ears, of a rectangular

St-FCI n°246/20.01.1998
GAIT / MOVEMENT: Free, enduring, vigorous, with drive.

forward line.

SKIN: Firm, thick, without wrinkles or dewlap, pigmented.

### COAT


Hair: Hair long, fine but firm, slightly wavy with a silky gloss; not
too much overdone.   The Czech Terrier is groomed by scissors
(clipping).  At the forepart of the head the hair is not to be clipped
thus forming brows and beard.  On the lower parts of the legs, under
the chest and belly the hair should not be clipped either.   In show
condition the hair at the upper side of the neck, on the shoulders and
on the back should not be longer than 1 - 1,5 cm; it should be shorter
on the sides of  the body and on the tail and quite short on the ears,
cheeks, at the lower side of the neck, on elbows, thighs and round the
vent.   The transition between clipped and unclipped areas should be
pleasing for the eye and never abrupt.

Colour: The Czech Terrier has 2 varieties of coat colour:
- grey-blue (puppies are born black)
- light-coffee-brown (puppies born chocolate brown)
In both colour varieties yellow, grey or white markings are permitted
on the head (beard, cheeks), neck, chest, belly, the limbs and round
the vent.  Sometimes there is also a white collar or a white tip of the
tail.  The basic colour, however, must always be predominant.

### HEIGHT AND WEIGHT:


Height at withers between 25 - 32 cm.   Ideal size for a dog = 29 cm,
for a bitch = 27 cm.
The weight must not be less than 6 kg and more than 10 kg.


FAULTS: Any departure  from the foregoing points should be
considered a fault and  the seriousness with which  the fault should
be  regarded should be in exact proportion to its degree and its effect
upon the health and welfare of the dog.
