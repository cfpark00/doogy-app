BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: This breed originated from
medium-sized dogs that existed in Japan in ancient times.  It became
established as a breed in the mountainous districts in Kishu
(Wakayama and Mie Prefecture).  Initially, these dogs’coats were
often marked with conspicuous colours such as red, sesame or
brindle.  From 1934, however, only solid colours were accepted for
this breed; conspicuously marked coats had disappeared by 1945,
never to reappear.  Currently, white coats may be found in this breed.
These dogs are used for hunting, now mainly wild boar, but at one
time also deer.  The breed took on the name of the region where it
was bred.  It was designated as a « natural monument » in 1934.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: Medium-sized dog, well balanced
and muscles well developed.  The dog has pricked ears and a curled
or sickle tail.  The conformation is strong, well boned and compact.

IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS: The ratio of height at withers to
length of body is 10 : 11.

BEHAVIOUR / TEMPERAMENT: Dog of noteworthy endurance,
showing nobility, dignity and naive feeling.  The temperament is
faithful, docile and very alert.
