FCI-St. N° 218 / 04.10.2019
TRANSLATION: Chris Seidler.  / Official language (ES).

ORIGIN: Mexico.

### DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THE OFFICIAL VALID



### STANDARD: 04.09.2019.



UTILIZATION: Companion dog.

FCI-CLASSIFICATION:  Group  9  Companion and Toy Dogs.

Section 6   Chihuahueño.

Without working trial.

BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: The Chihuahua is regarded as
the smallest pedigree dog in the world and carries the name of the
largest state of the Mexican Republic (Chihuahua).  One assumes
that these dogs used to live in the wild and, at the time of the Toltec
civilization, were captured and domesticated by the natives.
Representations of a Toy dog called « Techichi » which lived in
Tula, were used as decorations on town architecture.  These statues
are very similar to the present-day Chihuahua.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: This dog has a compact body.  Of
great importance is the fact that his skull is apple-shaped and that he
carries his moderately long tail very high, either curved or forming
the shape of a semicircle with the tip pointing towards the loin
region.

IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS: Length of body slightly greater
than height at withers.  Desired, however, is an almost square body,
especially in males. In bitches, because of the function of
reproduction, a slightly longer body is permitted.

BEHAVIOUR / TEMPERAMENT: Quick, alert, lively and very
courageous.




FCI-St. N° 218 / 04.10.2019


### HEAD



### CRANIAL REGION:


Skull: Well-rounded apple head (a characteristic of the breed).
Stop: Well marked, deep and broad as the forehead is rounded above
the set-on of muzzle.

### FACIAL REGION:


Nose: Any colour permitted. Moderately short, pointing slightly
upwards.
Muzzle: Short, straight seen from side, broad at set-on, tapering
towards the tip.
Lips: Lean and close fitting.
Jaws/Teeth: Scissor or pincer bite.  Overshot, undershot, as well as
any other anomaly in position of upper or lower jaw must be strictly
penalized.
Cheeks: Only slightly developed, very clean.

EYES: Large, roundish in shape, very expressive, not protruding,
perfectly dark.  Light eyes permissible, but not desired.

EARS: Large, upright, widely open, broad at set-on, gradually
tapering towards their slightly rounded tip.  In repose inclined
laterally forming an angle of 45°.

NECK: Upper profile slightly arched. Medium length. Thicker in
dogs than in bitches. Without dewlap. In the long-haired variety, the
presence of a neck-ruff with longer hair is highly desirable.

BODY: Compact and well built.
Topline: Level.
Withers: Only slightly marked.
Back: Short and firm.
Loin: Strongly muscled.
Croup: Broad and strong; almost flat or slightly sloping.
Chest: Ribcage broad and deep, ribs well sprung.  Seen from front,
roomy but not exaggerated. Seen from side, reaching to elbows. Not
barrel shaped.


FCI-St. N° 218 / 04.10.2019

Underline and belly: Formed by a clearly tucked up belly.  Slack
belly is permitted but not desired.

TAIL: Set on high, flat in appearance, of moderate length; broad at
root, tapering gradually towards the tip. Tail carriage is an important
characteristic of the breed : when the dog is moving it is carried
either high in a curve or in a semicircle with tip towards the loin
region, which gives balance to the body, it should never be carried
between the hindlegs nor curled below the backline. The hair on the
tail depends on the variety and is in harmony with the body coat. In
the long-haired variety, the tailcoat forms a plume. Tail is pendant in
repose and forms a slight hook.

### LIMBS



### FOREQUARTERS:


General appearance: Forelegs seen from the front form a straight line
with the elbows.  Seen from the side, they are upright.
Shoulder: Clean and moderately muscled.
Upper arm: Good angulation between shoulder-blade and upper arm.
Elbow: Firm and fitting close to body, which ensures free movement.
Forearm: Straight and of good length.
Metacarpus (Pastern): Slightly sloping, strong and flexible.
Forefeet: Very small and oval with toes well apart but not splayed
(neither hare- nor cat-foot).  Nails particularly well arched and
moderately long.  Pads well developed and very elastic. Dewclaws
are not desirable.

### HINDQUARTERS:


General appearance: Hindlegs well muscled with long bones, vertical
and parallel to each other with good angulation at hip, knee and hock
joints, in harmony with angulation of forequarters.
Metatarsus (Rear pastern): Short hocks with well-developed
Achilles’ tendons; seen from rear, they are well apart straight and
vertical.
Hind feet: Very small and oval with toes well apart but not splayed
(neither hare- nor cat-foot).


FCI-St. N° 218 / 04.10.2019
Nails particularly well arched and moderately long. Pads well
developed and very elastic. Dewclaws are not desirable.

GAIT / MOVEMENT: Steps are long, springy, energetic and active
with good reach and drive.  Seen from rear, hind legs should move
almost parallel to each other, so that the footprints of the hind feet fit
directly into those of the front feet. With increasing speed, the limbs
show a tendency to converge towards the median plane (single
track). Movement remains free and springy without visible effort,
head raised and back firm.

SKIN: Smooth and elastic all over body.

### COAT


Hair: In this breed there are two varieties of coat.
• Smooth-haired: Coat is short, lying close all over body.  If there is
an undercoat, the hair is somewhat longer; sparse coat on throat
and belly permissible; slightly longer on neck and tail, short on
face and ears.  Coat is glossy and its texture is soft.  Hairless dogs
are not tolerated.
• Longed-haired: Coat should be fine and silky, smooth or slightly
wavy.  Not too thick undercoat desired.  Coat is longer, forming
feathering on ears, neck, rear of front and hind legs, on feet and
on tail.  Dogs with long billowing coat will not be accepted.

Colour: All colours in all possible shades and combinations are
admitted, except merle colour.

SIZE AND WEIGHT: In this breed, only the weight is taken into
consideration, not the height.
Weight: 1 to 3 kg.  Ideal weight: between 1,5 and 2,5 kg.
Subjects weighing less than 1 kg and more than 3 kg shall be
disqualified.




FCI-St. N° 218 / 04.10.2019
