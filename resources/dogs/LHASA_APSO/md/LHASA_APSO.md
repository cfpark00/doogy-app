Without working trial.

BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: The Lhasa Apso comes from
Tibet where many live at high altitudes and the climate can be
severe. He has to be a hardy little dog to withstand these conditions,
and this has had a great influence on his development. His long, hard
coat with its dense undercoat acts as insulation during winter, and
the fall of hair over his eyes protects them from the wind, dust and
glare.
The Apso is one of several Eastern breeds to come to the West. The
first Apsos arrived in Britain in the early 1920s and were being
shown in London soon after. When they were first seen in Britain
they were confused with other shaggy Oriental dogs and all were
labelled ‘Lhasa Terriers’. Later a distinction was made, especially
between the Apso and the Tibetan Terrier which is thought to have
been behind the early Apsos. A breed club for the Lhasa Apso was
established in Britain in 1933.
