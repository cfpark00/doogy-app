BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: In the beginning, the history
of the American Akitas is similar to the history of Japanese Akitas.
Since 1603, in the Akita region, Akita Matagis (medium-sized bearhunting dogs) were used as fighting dogs.  From 1868, Akita Matagis
were crossbred with Tosas and Mastiffs. Consequently, the size of
Akitas increased, but characteristics associated with Spitz type were
lost.  In 1908 dog fighting was prohibited, but Akitas were
nevertheless preserved and improved as a large Japanese breed.  As a
result, nine superior examples of Akitas were designated as « Natural
Monuments » in 1931.
During World War II (1939-1945), it was common to use dogs as a
source of fur for military garments.  The police ordered the capture
and confiscation of all dogs other than German Shepherd Dogs used
for military purposes.  Some fanciers tried to circumvent the order by
crossbreeding their dogs with German Shepherd Dogs.  When World
War II ended, Akitas had been drastically reduced in number and
existed as three distinct types: 1) Matagi Akitas 2) Fighting Akitas 3)
Shepherd Akitas.  This created a very confusing situation in the
breed.  During the restoration process of the pure breed after the war,
Kongo-go of the Dewa line enjoyed a temporary, but tremendous
popularity.  Many Akitas of the Dewa line, which exhibited
characteristics of the Mastiff and German Shepherd influence, were
brought back to the United States by members of the Military Forces.


FCI-St. N° 344 / 29.01.2015
The Akitas from the Dewa line, intelligent and capable of adapting to
different environments, fascinated breeders in the United States and
the line was developed with increasing number of breeders and a
great rise in popularity.
The Akita Club of America was established in 1956 and the
American Kennel Club (AKC) accepted the breed (inscription into
the stud book and regular show status) in October 1972.  However, at
this time, the AKC and the JKC (Japan Kennel Club) did not have
reciprocal agreements for recognizing each other’s pedigrees and
therefore the door was closed for the introduction of the new
bloodlines from Japan.  Consequently, Akitas in the United States
became considerably different from those in Japan, the country of
origin.  They developed as a type unique in the United States, with
characteristics and type unchanged since 1955.  This is in sharp
contrast with Akitas in Japan which were crossbred with Matagi
Akitas for the purpose of restoring the original pure breed.
