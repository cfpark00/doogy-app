BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY:  Like the other Irish Terrier
breeds it is assumed that the Kerry Blue has been in the country for
centuries, but, once again, because of its humble origins as a rat
catcher and all-round farm dog, there are few, if any references to the
breed before the 20th century.  The first probable literary references
to the Kerry Blue dates from 1847  the author describes a bluish slate
coloured dog, marked with darker blotches and patches, and often
with the tan about the legs and muzzle.  This blackish-blue Irish
terrier was supposed to be prevalent in Kerry but it has been
developed in other counties as well.  The blue didn’t make its first
appearance on the show benches until 1913, and the Dublin Blue
Terrier Club was formed in 1920.  The Kerry Blue became quickly
so popular as a sort of mascot for Irish patriots that there were
actually four clubs promoting its interests for a short time, and
between 1922 and 1924 these clubs sponsored no fewer than six
shows and six field trials. By 1928 this impressive balanced terrier
with its beautiful soft blue coat became popular worldwide and its
reputation as an excellent working and companion dog agreed with
the breed assessment as « well nigh perfect ».
