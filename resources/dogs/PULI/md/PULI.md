### STANDARD: 29.10.2013.

BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: The Puli is a Hungarian
herding breed of Asiatic origin. His original ancestors most probably
came to the Carpathian Basin with the migrating ancient Magyars,
who lived as nomads on stock-breeding.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: Dog of medium size with strong
constitution, square build and fine, but not too light bones. The
somewhat lean body is well muscled all over. The construction of the
individual body parts is difficult to judge, as the whole body is
covered by a strongly developed coat, tending to form curls and
cords. It is therefore useful to touch the dog when judging. The coat
on the head is so profuse that the head appears round and the eyes are
almost covered. The profusely coated tail, curled forward over the
back, gives the appearance of the topline rising slightly towards the
rear.

### IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS:


The body length is equal to the height at the withers.
The depth of the brisket is slightly less than half of the height at the
withers.
The length of the muzzle is one third of the total length of the head.



St-FCI n°55 / 06.12.2013

BEHAVIOUR / TEMPERAMENT: Of lively temperament,
extremely able to learn. Loves children and is an excellent watchdog.
His present shape has adapted him to sporting use.

HEAD: Seen from the front, round, seen from the side appears to be
elliptic.

### CRANIAL REGION:

Stop: Barely developed.

Lips: Taut, with dark pigmentation.
Jaws/Teeth: Complete scissor bite according to the dentition formula
(42 teeth).

EYES: Of medium size, dark brown, set in slightly oblique and
medium wide apart. The expression is lively and intelligent. Rims of
lids close-fitting to the eyeball and well pigmented.

EARS: Set on at medium height with broad base. The pendant
leathers V-shaped with rounded tips.

NECK: Of medium length, taut, well muscled. Forms an angle of
about 45 degrees to the horizontal and is covered by dense coat.

### BODY:

the rear because of the tail carriage.

the hocks.

### LIMBS



### FOREQUARTERS:

vertical line from the withers touches the front part of the chest at its
deepest point. The angle between shoulder blade and upper arm is
100 to 110 degrees.
Upper Arm: Medium long, well muscled.
Elbow: Lying closely to the brisket. Angle between upper arm and
forearm: 120 to 130 degrees.
Forearm: Long, straight, with dry muscles.
Forefeet: Short, rounded, tight with well-knit toes. Nails black or
dark slate grey. Pads dark in colour and springy. Feet parallel,
pointing forward and medium wide apart.

### HINDQUARTERS:


General appearance:  The legs are medium wide apart and parallel.
The angle between pelvis and upper thigh is about 100 to 110
degrees.
Thigh: Long and well-muscled.
Stifle (Knee): Angulation of stifle joint 100 to 110 degrees.
Lower thigh: Long and well-muscled.
Hock joint: Dry, clean-cut.
Metatarsus (Rear pastern): Short.
Hind feet: Not as tight and well-knit as front feet, otherwise
similar.

GAIT/MOVEMENT: Very lively and spirited. Steps short. The gait
is often typically mincing and jumping. The dog has a tendency to
spin round himself.




St-FCI n°55 / 06.12.2013
SKIN: Without wrinkles, tight, with strong pigment. The bare skin is
black or slate grey in all coat colours.

### COAT


Hair: The puppy coat is dense, wavy or curly. Later, there are tufts of
hair developing to tassels and cords. The coat consists of a coarser
top coat and a finer undercoat. The relation between these two types
of hair determines the character of the coat. If the topcoat highly
predominate the undercoat, the coat structure is untypical and the
coat sticks slightly out. If the undercoat is too highly predominant –
which is undesirable – this results in a matted coat of too soft texture,
difficult to groom. The correct proportion between the two types of
hair, which is genetically fixed, produces the aesthetical tassels or
cords, which are easy to groom. The cords on the loin and the croup
and at the back of the upper thighs are longest (20–30 cm).  They are
shortest on the head and at the limbs (10-12 cm). Coat on head is
ideal when the hair forms a strong structure of cords covering the
facial region. Both a combed out and a neglected, tousled coat are
undesirable.

Colour:
Black.
Black with few rusty coloured or grey shadings.
Fawn (fakó) with a distinct black mask.
Grey in any shade.
A white patch at the forechest, not exceeding 3 cm in diameter, is
permitted. White between the toes is not regarded as a fault.
Pearl white coat, without any russet gold (semmelblond).

### SIZE AND WEIGHT:



Height at the withers:
Males:    39–45 cm. Ideal height: 41–43 cm.
Females: 36–42 cm. Ideal height: 38–40 cm.

Weight: Males: 13–15 kg. Females: 10–13 kg.




St-FCI n°55 / 06.12.2013
FAULTS: Any departure from the foregoing points should be
considered a fault and the seriousness with which the fault is

upon the health and welfare of the dog and its ability to perform its
traditional work.
