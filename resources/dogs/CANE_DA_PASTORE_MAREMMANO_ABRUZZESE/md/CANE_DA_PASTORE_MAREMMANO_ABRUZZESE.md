TRANSLATION: Mrs. Peggy Davis. Revised by Renée SporreWilles. Official language (EN).

ORIGIN: Italy.

### DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THE OFFICIAL VALID

UTILIZATION: Shepherd dog used mainly for the protection of
flocks and guarding of properties.

FCI-CLASSIFICATION:  Group  1  Sheepdogs and cattle dogs



except Swiss cattledogs.

Section 1 Sheepdogs.

Without working trial.

BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: This ancient breed of dogs
who guard flocks comes from shepherd dogs actually still used in the
Abruzzes where the breeding of sheep is still thriving even in these
days, and sheepdogs which existed yesteryear in the region of the
Tuscan Maremma and in that of Latium. Especially since 1860, the
seasonal moving of livestock from one region to another has favoured
the developing of a natural crossing of those two primitive breeds.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: The Maremma and Abruzzes shepherd
dog is a big dog, strongly built of a rustic appearance, at the same time
majestic is really typical. On the whole his shape, of average
proportions, is that of a heavy dog, whose body is longer than the
height at the withers; is balanced as much in size (heterometry =
normal proportions between the size and different parts of the body)
as to the profiles (alloidism = concordance between the profiles of the
head and the body).

IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS: The length of the head reaches
4:10 of the height at the withers; muzzle slightly shorter than the
length of the skull; the body length is more, by 1:18, than the height
at the withers. Depth of thorax is slightly less than half the height at
the withers.


FCI-St. N° 201/ 18.01.2024

BEHAVIOUR/TEMPERAMENT: The principal function as a
guard and defence dog of flocks and property in general, asserts the
manner in accomplishing these tasks, with perception and also with
devotions to his master and all his entourage.

HEAD: On the whole the head is large and flat, of conical shape,
reminiscing of that of a polar bear.

### CRANIAL REGION:


Skull: Of great width with lateral sides slightly bulging. In profile also
convex. The upper longitudinal axes of the skull and muzzle are
slightly divergent, which makes the profile of the head slightly
convex. The superciliary arches are moderately marked. The mediofrontal furrow line is slightly marked. The occipital crest is only just
visible.
Stop: The fronto-nasal depression only just accentuated and the
fronto-nasal angle is always very open.

### FACIAL REGION:


Nose: Rather big, in line of the muzzle, with large well-opened
nostrils, moist and cool, coloured black. In profile must not protrude
beyond the front marginal of the lips.
Muzzle: The length is little less than that of the skull, depth is half of
the length, lateral sides are slightly converging, decreases towards the
front but still keeping a blunt surface seen from the front. The region
under the eyes is slightly chiselled.
Lips: Seen from the front, the upper lips, at their junction point,
determined by their lower edge a semicircle of very short radius.
Slightly developed, they barely cover the teeth of the jaw, and,
therefore, the corner of the lip is only lightly accentuated.

Consequently, the lower lateral profile is only defined by the lips in its
fore part, in its rear part it is defined by the lower jaw and the corner
of the lip. The rims of the lips are black.




FCI-St. N° 201/ 18.01.2024

Jaws/ Teeth: Strong jaws, normally developed, with incisors set
straight, well aligned of good size and complete in number. Teeth
white and strong, scissor bite.
Cheeks: Moderately visible.

EYES: Not large in relation to the size of the dog; the iris is of an
ochre colour or chestnut brown. The eye, in lateral position, is neither
deep set nor protruding. Lively and attentive expression. Eyelid
opening is almond shaped, with black eye rims.

EARS: Set very high over the zygomatic arches, they are natural,
hanging but very mobile. Triangular shape (in V), their extremities
forming a narrow point never rounded; they are small in relation to the
size of the dog. For a medium size dog their length must not go beyond
12 cm. The ear attachment is of medium width.

NECK: Upper profile moderately arched. The neck is always shorter
than the head. Neck is thick and very strongly muscled and always
without dewlap; covered with long and dense hair forming a collar
particularly obvious in males.

BODY: Solidly constructed.
Top line: Straight from withers to rump where it becomes somewhat
sloping.
Withers: Slightly above the topline; wide because of the distance
separating the shoulder blades.
Back: Straight in profile, length reaches about 32% of the height at the
withers.
Loin: Merging perfectly with the topline and has a slightly curved
profile with well-developed muscles and width.
Croup: Broad, strong and well-muscled. The inclination from the hip
to the tail set is of 20° increasing to 30° and more, hence the rump is
sloping.




FCI-St. N° 201/ 18.01.2024
Chest: Ample, descending to level of elbows, deep and well-rounded
at mid-height.
Decreases progressively downwards while retaining a good width in
the sternal region. Its depth must reach half the height at the withers.
The ribs are well sprung and oblique with ample lung space and good
width; the last false ribs are long, oblique and well opened.
Underline and belly: The sternum is long and the sternal line is rising
slightly towards the belly.

TAIL: Low set due to the sloping rump, in normal stand reaching
below the level of the hock. Hanging when dog stationary; carried
level with back line with a rather strongly hooked extremity when the
dog is in action. Well furnished with dense hairs without fringes.

### LIMBS



FOREQUARTERS: Straight limbs seen from the front and in profile;
forequarters well balanced in relation to the body, and the various parts
of the forequarters are well proportioned between them.
Shoulder: Long, oblique with powerful muscles. Must be really free
in movement. In length measures about 1∕4 of the height at the withers.
Its obliqueness below the horizontal is 50°– 60°.
Upper arm: Set close to the body in its upper two thirds, with powerful
muscles. The obliqueness below the horizontal varies between 55° and
60°; its length measures about the 30% of the height at the withers. Its
position is more or less parallel with the median plane of the body.
The scapulo-humeral angle varies between 105° and 120°.
Elbow: Normally close to the chest, covered with soft loose skin.
Parallel to the median plane of the body. Point of elbow must be on an
imaginary vertical line from the rear angle of the shoulder blade. The
humero-radial angle varies between 145° and 150°.
Forearm: Straight and vertical, heavily boned. The length slightly
supersedes the length of the upper arm.
Carpus (Wrist): In extension of the vertical line of the forearm. Strong,
clean, smooth and of good thickness; the pisiform bone is clearly
protruding.



FCI-St. N° 201/ 18.01.2024

Metacarpus (Pastern): The length neither too short nor too high. Lean
with a minimum of sub-cutaneous tissue. Seen in profile is slightly
oblique towards the front.
Forefeet: Large, of roundish shape, well closed toes, covered with
short thick hair, nails preferably black, but brownish tolerated.

HINDQUARTERS: Seen as a whole: limbs are straight when seen
from behind and in profile. In proportion to the body and with the
various parts harmoniously connected.
Thigh: Long, slightly oblique, broad with protruding muscles and the
rear edge slightly convex. The coxo-femoral (hip bone) angle is about
100°.
Stifle (Knee): Firm, well placed in the vertical axe. The femoro-tibial
angle not excessively angulated.
Lower thigh: The length is a little less than the thigh. Obliqueness
below the horizontal is about 60°. Strong bone, muscles lean and the
groove in the leg well marked.
Hock joint: Quite thick and broad. The angle varies between 140° and
150°.
Metatarsus (Rear pastern): Strong, lean and broad, neither too long nor
too short. The presence of dewclaws is tolerated.

Hind feet: Large, not as roundish in shape as forefeet, well closed toes,
covered with short thick hair, nails preferably black, but brown is
tolerated.

GAIT/MOVEMENT: Walk and extended trot.

SKIN: Tight in all parts of the body; rather thick. Black pigmentation

### COAT:


Hair: Very well furnished. Hair long, rather harsh to the touch, close
to straight horsehair. Flat lying on the body, slight wave is tolerated.
The hair forms an important collar around the neck and fringes of
limited length on the edge of the hindquarters. But the hair is short on
the muzzle, on the skull, the ears and front of the limbs.


FCI-St. N° 201/ 18.01.2024

the health and welfare of the dog and its ability to perform its
traditional work.
