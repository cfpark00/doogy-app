### STANDARD: 22.08.2017.



UTILIZATION: Terrier.

### FCI-CLASSIFICATION:


Group 3
Terriers.

Section 2
Small-sized Terriers.

Without working trial.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: Distinctive head with beautiful silky
covering, with large, wise intelligent eyes offsetting long, low
weaselly body.  Short, strong legs; weatherproof coat.

BEHAVIOUR AND TEMPERAMENT: Game, workmanlike
Terrier.   Independent, highly intelligent, determined, persistent,
sensitive, affectionate and dignified.

HEAD: Head strongly made, large but in proportion to dog’s size,
muscles showing extraordinary development, especially the
maxillary.

### CRANIAL REGION:


Skull: Broad, narrowing towards eye, measuring about the same
from inner corner of eye to back of skull, as from ear to ear.
Forehead well domed; head covered with very soft, silky hair not
confined to mere « topknot ».

### FACIAL REGION:


Nose: Black.
Muzzle: In proportion to skull as three is to five.  Top of muzzle has
triangular bare patch pointing backwards to eyes from nose about
2,5 cm broad.
Cheeks: Gradually tapering towards deep and strongly made muzzle.



St-FCI n°168/ 03.10.2017
Jaws/Teeth: Jaws strong with a perfect, regular and complete scissor
bite, i.e. upper teeth closely overlapping the lower teeth and set
square to the jaws.  Any deviation highly undesirable.
Teeth very strong, especially canines which are extraordinary in size
for a small dog.  Canines fit well against each other, to give greatest
available holding and punishing power.  Inside of mouth black or
dark coloured.

EYES: Rich dark hazel; set wide apart and low, large for a small
dog, bright, full and round but not protruding.

EARS: Pendulous, set well back, wide apart, low on skull, hanging
close to cheek with very slight projection at base ; broad at junction
of head and tapering almost to a point, fore part of ear coming almost
straight down from its junction with head to tip.  Cartilage and skin
of ear very thin.  Length of ear, from 7 ½ -10 cm.  Ears harmonise in
colour with body colour.  In a pepper dog, covered with soft, straight,
dark hair (in some cases almost black).
In a mustard dog, hair mustard in colour, a shade darker than body
but not black.  Both should have a thin feather of light hair starting
about 5 cm from the tip, and of nearly the same colour and texture as
« topknot », giving ear appearance of a distinct point.  This may not
appear until after age of two years.

NECK: Very muscular, well developed and strong, showing great
power.  Well set into shoulders.

BODY: Long, strong and flexible.
Back: Rather low at shoulders having slight downward curve and
corresponding arch over loins, slight gradual drop from top of loin to
root of tail.  Backbone well muscled.
Chest: Well developed and well let down between forelegs.
Ribs: Well sprung and round.

TAIL: Rather short from 20-25 cm, rather thick at root, getting
thicker for about 10 cm and tapering off to a point.




St-FCI n°168/ 03.10.2017

Not twisted or curled in any way but with a curve like a scimitar, the
tip when excited being in a perpendicular line with root of tail, set
neither too high nor too low.  When not excited carried gaily a little
above body level.

### LIMBS



FOREQUARTERS: Forelegs short with immense muscular
development and bone, set wide apart and chest coming well down
between them.  Bandy legs highly undesirable.
Shoulders: Well laid back but not heavy.
Forearm: To follow line of chest.
Forefeet: Pointing forward or slightly outward when standing.

HINDQUARTERS: Hindlegs a little longer than forelegs; set rather
wide apart, but not spread out in an unnatural manner.
Thighs: Well developed.
Stifles: Angulated.
Hocks: Well let down.  Dewclaws, if present, customarily removed.
Hindfeet: Round and well padded.  Hindfeet smaller than forefeet.
Nails dark but varying in shade according to colour of body.  Flat or
open feet highly undesirable.

GAIT / MOVEMENT: Strong, straight impulsion from rear, giving
a fluent free and easy stride, reaching forward at the front.  A stiff,
stilted, hopping or weaving gait highly undesirable.

### COAT


Hair: Very important feature of the breed.  Hair should be about 5 cm
long.  Double coat with a soft linty undercoat and a harder topcoat,
not wiry but giving crisp feel to the hand.  The coat should not
« shed » down the back but should lie in pencils caused by the harder
hair coming through the softer undercoat.  The forelegs have feather
about 5 cm long.  Upper side of tail covered with wiry hair,
underside not so wiry with neat feathering of softer hair.




St-FCI n°168/ 03.10.2017
Colour: Pepper or mustard.
• Pepper: Ranges from dark bluish black to light silvery grey,
intermediate shades preferred.  Body colour coming well down
shoulder and hips gradually   merging into colour of legs and feet
which varies according to body colour from rich tan to pale fawn.
Profuse silvery white « topknot ».
• Mustard: Varies from reddish brown to pale fawn.  Profuse
creamy white « topknot », legs and feet of a darker shade than
head.

In both colours feather on forelegs rather lighter than hair on fore
part of leg.  Some white hair on chest and white nails permissible.
White feet undesirable.  Hair on underside of tail lighter than on
upperside which should be darker colour than body.

WEIGHT: 8-11 kg for dogs in good working condition.  The lower
weights preferred.

FAULTS: Any departure from the foregoing points should be
considered a fault and the seriousness with which the fault should be
regarded should be in exact proportion to its degree and its effect
upon the health and welfare of the dog.

### DISQUALIFYING FAULTS:


• Aggressive or overly shy dogs.
• Any dog clearly showing physical or behavioural abnormalities.

### N.B:


• Male animals should have two apparently normal testicles fully
descended into the scrotum.
• Only functionally and clinically healthy dogs, with breed typical
conformation, should be used for breeding.
