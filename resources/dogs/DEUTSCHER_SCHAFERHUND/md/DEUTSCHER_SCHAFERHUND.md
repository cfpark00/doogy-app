Brief historical overview:

According to the official documentation of the Verein für Deutsche
Schäferhunde (SV) e.V. (Society for the German Shepherd Dog,
“SV” for short) – legal domicile in Augsburg, Germany, member of
the Verband für das Deutsche Hundewesen (VDH, German Kennel
Club) – the "SV" as the founding club of the breed is responsible for
the breed standard of the German Shepherd Dog. Established in the
first General Meeting at Frankfurt/Main on 20 September 1899
according to suggestions by A. Meyer and Max von Stephanitz and
in addition to the amendments of the 6th General Meeting on 28 July
1901, the 23rd General Meeting at Cologne/Rhineland on 17
September 1909, the Executive Board & Advisory Board Meeting at
Wiesbaden on 5 September 1930 and the Breeding Committee &
Executive Board Meeting on 25 March 1961, revisions were resolved
within the framework of the World Union of German Shepherd Dog
Clubs (WUSV) Meeting on 30 August 1976.
Revisions and catalogued measures were resolved with the Enabling
Resolution through the Executive Board and Advisory Board from
23/24 March 1991, amended through the Federal Conventions from


## 25 May 1997 and 31 May/1 June 2008.





St-FCI n°166/ 23.12.2010

The German Shepherd Dog, whose methodical breeding was started
in 1899 after the foundation of the society, had been bred from the
central German and southern German breeds of the herding dogs
existing at that time with the ultimate objective of creating a working
dog inclined to high achievements. In order to achieve this objective,
the breed standard of the German Shepherd Dog was determined,
which relates to the physical constitution as well as the traits and
characteristics.

### General appearance



The German Shepherd Dog is medium-size, slightly elongated,
powerful and well-muscled, with dry bone and firm overall structure.

### Important dimensional ratios



The height at the withers amounts to 60 cm to 65 cm for male dogs
and 55 cm to 60 cm for female dogs. The trunk length exceeds the
dimension at the height at the withers by about 10 – 17 %.

### Character



The German Shepherd Dog must be well-balanced (with strong
nerves) in terms of character, self-assured, absolutely natural and
(except for a stimulated situation) good-natured as well as attentive
and willing to please. He must possess instinctive behaviour,
resilience and self-assurance in order to be suitable as a companion,
guard, protection, service and herding dog.

### Head



The head is wedge-shaped, and in proportion to the body size (length
about 40 % at the height at the withers), without being plump or too
elongated, dry in the overall appearance and moderately broad
between the ears.
Seen from the front and side, the forehead is only slightly arched and
without any or with only a slightly indicated middle furrow.



St-FCI n°166/ 23.12.2010

The ratio from the cranial region to the facial region is 50 % to 50 %.
The width of the cranial region more or less corresponds to the
length of the cranial region. The cranial region (seen from above)
tapers evenly towards the nasal bridge with gradually sloping, not
sharply depicted stop in the wedge-shaped facial region (foreface) of
the head. Upper and lower jaws are powerfully developed.

The nasal dorsum is straight, any dip or bulge is undesirable. The lips
are taut, close well and are of dark colouring.

The nose must be black.

The teeth must be strong, healthy and complete (42 teeth according
to the dental formula). The German Shepherd Dog has a scissor bite,
i.e. the incisors must interlock like scissors, whereby the incisors of
the upper jaw overlap those of the lower jaw. Occlusal overlay,
overbite and retrusive occlusion as well as larger spaces between the
teeth (gaps) are faulty. The straight dental ridge of the incisors is also
faulty. The jaw bones must be strongly developed so that the teeth
can be deeply embedded in the dental ridge.


THE EYES are of medium size, almond-shaped, slightly slanted and
not protruding. The colour of the eyes should be as dark as possible.
Light, piercing eyes are undesirable since they impair the dog’s
impression.

### EARS



The German Shepherd Dog has erect ears of medium size, which are
carried upright and aligned (not drawn-in laterally); they are pointed
and with the auricle facing forward.

Tipped ears and drooping ears are faulty. Ears carried rearward when
moving or in relaxed position are not faulty.





St-FCI n°166/ 23.12.2010
Neck

The neck should be strong, well-muscled and without loose neck
skin (dewlap). The angulation towards the trunk (horizontal)
amounts to approx. 45°.

### Body



The upper line runs from the base of the neck via the high, long
withers and via the straight back towards the slightly sloping croup,
without visible interruption. The back is moderately long, firm,
strong and well-muscled. The loin is broad, short, strongly developed
and well-muscled. The croup should be long and slightly sloping
(approx 23° to the horizontal) and the upper line should merge into
the base of the tail without interruption.

The chest should be moderately broad, the lower chest as long and
pronounced as possible. The depth of the chest should amount to
approx. 45 % to 48 % of the height at the withers.

The ribs should feature a moderate curvature; a barrel-shaped chest
is just as faulty as flat ribs.

The tail extends at least to the hock, but not beyond the middle of
the hind pastern. It has slightly longer hair on the underside and is
carried hanging downward in a gentle curve, whereby in a state of
excitement and in motion it is raised and carried higher, but not
beyond the horizontal. Operative corrections are forbidden.


### Limbs



### Forequarters



The forelimbs are straight when seen from all sides, and absolutely
parallel when seen from the front.




St-FCI n°166/ 23.12.2010
Shoulder blade and upper arm are of equal length, and firmly
attached to the trunk by means of powerful musculature. The
angulation from shoulder blade and upper arm is ideally 90°, but
generally up to 110°.

The elbows may not be turned out either while standing or moving,
and also not pushed in. The forearms are straight when seen from all
sides, and absolutely parallel to each other, dry and firmly muscled.
The pastern has a length of approx. 1/3 of the forearm, and has an
angle of approx. 20° to 22° to the forearm. A slanted pastern (more
than 22°) as well as a steep pastern (less than 20°) impairs the
suitability for work, particularly the stamina.

The paws are rounded, well-closed and arched; the soles are hard,
but not brittle. The nails are strong and of dark colour.

### Hindquarters



The position of hind legs is slightly backwards, whereby the hind
limbs are parallel to each other when seen from the rear. Upper leg
and lower leg are of approximately the same length and form an
angle of approx. 120°; the legs are strong and well-muscled.

The hocks are strongly developed and firm; the hind pastern stands
vertically under the hock.

The paws are closed, slightly arched; the pads are hard and of dark
colour; the nails are strong, arched and also of dark colour.

### Gait



The German Shepherd Dog is a trotter. The limbs must be
coordinated in length and angulations so that the dog can shift the
hindquarters towards the trunk without any essential change of the
top line and can reach just as far with the forelimbs. Any tendency
towards over-angulation of the hindquarters reduces the stability and
the stamina, and thereby the working ability.




St-FCI n°166/ 23.12.2010

Correct body proportions and angulations results in a gait that is farreaching and flat over the ground which conveys the impression of
effortless forward movements. The head pushed forward and the
slightly raised tail result in a consistent, smooth trot showing a gently
curved, uninterrupted upper line from the ear tips over the neck and
back to the end of the tail.

### Skin



The skin is (loosely) fitting, but without forming any folds.

### Coat



### Hair texture



Hair:

The German Shepherd Dog is bred in the hair varieties double coat
and long double coat – both with undercoat.

Double coat:

The guard hair should be as dense as possible, particularly harsh and
close fitting: short on the head, including the inside of the ears, short
on the front side of the legs, paws and toes, some-what longer and
more strongly covered in hair on the neck. On the back side of the
legs the hair extends to the carpal joint or the hock; it forms
moderate ‘trousers’ on the back side of the haunches.

Long double coat:

The guard hair should be long, soft and not close fitting, with tufts on
the ears and legs, bushy trousers and bushy tail with downward
formation of tuft. Short on the head, including the inside of the ears,
on the front side of the legs, on the paws and toes, somewhat longer
and more strongly covered in hair on the neck, almost forming a
mane.



St-FCI n°166/ 23.12.2010
On the back side of the legs the hair extends to the carpal joint or the
hock and forms clear trousers on the back side of the haunches.

### Colours


Colours are black with reddish-brown, brown and yellow to light
grey markings; single-coloured black, grey with darker shading,
black saddle and mask. Unobtrusive, small white marks on chest as
well as very light colour on insides are permissible, but not desirable.
The tip of the nose must be black in all colours. Dogs with lack of
mask, light to piercing eye colour, as well as with light to whitish
markings on the chest and the insides, pale nails and red tip of tail
are considered to be lacking in pigmentation. The undercoat shows a
light greyish tone.  The colour white is not allowed.
Size/weight

Male dogs:
Height at the withers: 60 cm to 65 cm
Weight: 30 kg to 40 kg

Female dogs:
Height at the withers: 55 cm to 60 cm
Weight: 22 kg to 32 kg


Faults: Any departure from the foregoing points should be
considered a fault and the seriousness with which the fault should be
regarded should be in exact proportion to its degree and its effect
upon the health and welfare of the dog.

### Serious faults



Deviations from the above-described breed characteristics which
impair the working capability.




St-FCI n°166/ 23.12.2010
Faulty ears: ears set too low laterally, tipped ears, inward constricted
ears, ears not firm

Considerable pigment deficiencies.

Severely impaired overall stability.

Dental faults:

All deviations from scissor bite and dental formula insofar as it does
not involve eliminating faults (see the following)


### Disqualifying faults



a) Dogs with weak character and weak nerves which bite
b) Any dog clearly showing physical or behavioural
abnormalities.
c) Monorchid or cryptorchid dogs as well as dogs with clearly
dissimilar or atrophied testicles
d) Dogs with disfiguring ears or tail faults
e) Dogs with malformations
f) Dogs with dental faults, with lack of:
1 premolar 3 and another tooth, or
1 canine tooth, or
1 premolar 4, or
1 molar 1 or molar 2, or
a total of 3 teeth or more
g) Dogs with jaw deficiencies:
Overshot by 2 mm and more,
undershot,
level bite in the entire incisor region
h) Dogs with oversize or undersize by more than 1 cm
i) Albinism
j) White hair colour (also with dark eyes and nails)
k) Long Straight Topcoat without undercoat



St-FCI n°166/ 23.12.2010
l) Long-haired (long, soft guard hair without undercoat, mostly
parted in the middle of the back, tufts on the ears and legs
and on the tail)

### N.B:


•
Male animals should have two apparently normal testicles
fully descended into the scrotum.
•
Only functionally and clinically healthy dogs, with breed
typical conformation, should be used for breeding.
