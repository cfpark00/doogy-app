FCI-St. N° 225 / 04.10.2016
TRANSLATION: Jennifer Mulholland & Raymond Triquet.
Official language (EN).

ORIGIN: Brazil.

### DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THE OFFICIAL VALID



### STANDARD:  29/09/2016.



UTILIZATION: Watch Dog.

FCI-CLASSIFICATION:  Group 2
Pinscher and

Schnauzer-Molossoid

breeds- Swiss Mountain

and Cattle Dogs.

Section 2.1.  Molossoid breeds,

Mastiff type.

Without working trial.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: Typically a molossoid breed.
Powerful bones, rectangular and compact structure, but harmonious
and well-proportioned. Displays, together with a massive body, a
great amount of concentrated agility which is easily perceived. The
sexual dimorphism must be very well defined and obvious
(feminine females, masculine males).

### IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS:


•
The muzzle is slightly shorter than the skull.
•
The length of the body- measured from the point of the
sternum to the point of buttock - exceeds of the height at
the withers with 15%.

BEHAVIOUR/TEMPERAMENT: Courage, determination and
outstanding braveness are part of its characteristics. With its owners
and family it is docile, obedient and extremely tolerant with children.



FCI-St. N° 225 / 04.10.2016
Its loyalty is proverbial, insistently seeking the company of its
master.
It displays a calm disposition, distinctive self-assurance and selfconfidence,
remaining
unperturbed
by
strange
noises
or
circumstances. An unsurpassed guardian of properties, it also
instinctively indulges in big game hunting and cattle herding. While
one of its characteristics is a natural aloofness towards strangers
especially in its own territory, it must be susceptible to controlled
handling, especially in the show ring.
In repose it is calm; noble and full of self-assurance.  Never
displaying a bored or absent expression. When alert, its expression
should reflect determination conveyed by a firm, penetrating look.

HEAD: The head of the Fila is big, heavy and massive, always
proportionate to the whole body.  From a top view it resembles a
trapezoid figure into which a pear shape is inserted.

### CRANIAL REGION:


Skull: The profile of the skull shows a smooth curve from the stop to
the occiput, which is well-defined and protuberant especially in
puppies.  From a front view it is large, broad with the upper line
slightly curved.  Lateral lines come down almost vertically, in a
slight continuous curve narrowing towards the muzzle.
Stop: From a front view it is practically non-existent. The median
groove is slight and runs up smoothly to approximately the centre of
the skull.  Seen from the side, the stop is only slightly pronounced
and virtually only formed by the well-developed eyebrows.

### FACIAL REGION:


Nose: Well-developed, broad nostrils not occupying entirely the
width of the upper jaw. Colour: black.
Muzzle: Strong, broad and deep, always in harmony with the skull.
Fairly deep at the root but not deeper than long.  Seen from above, it
is full under the eyes, slightly narrowing towards the middle of the
muzzle and again broadening slightly to the front line.



FCI-St. N° 225 / 04.10.2016
Seen from the side, the muzzle is straight or has a Roman line, but
never turned up.  The front line of the muzzle is almost perpendicular
to the bridge of the nose with a slight depression right under the
nose.
Lips: The upper lip is thick and pendulous and overlaps the lower lip
in a perfect curve; thus the lower line of the muzzle is almost parallel
to the upper line. The lower lip is tight and firm to the fangs and
from there on it is loose with dented borders ending at the corners
which are always apparent. The muzzle has a good depth at the root
but without surpassing the length.  Edges of the lips form a deep
inverted “U”.
Teeth/jaws: The teeth are significantly wider than long. Strong and
white. Upper incisors are broad at their root and taper to the edge.
Canines are powerful, well set and well apart. The ideal bite is the
scissor bite.

EYES: From medium to large size, almond shaped, spaced well
apart, medium to deep set.  Permissible colours - from dark brown to
yellow, always in accordance with the colour of the coat. However,
a darker colour is preferred. Due to the loose skin, many
individuals present drooping lower eyelids which are not considered
a fault as such; a detail accentuates the melancholic expression which
is typical of the breed.

EARS: Pendant, large, thick, V-shaped.  Broad at the base and
tapering to the ends.  Rounded tips.  Attached at the back of the
skull, in line with the eyes when in repose.  When roused, the ears
are above the original position.  The root is oblique, with the front
edge higher than the back edge. Falling over the cheeks or folded
back showing the inside (rose ear).

NECK: Extraordinarily strong and muscled giving the impression of
a short neck.  Slightly curved at the upper side and well detached
from the skull.  Dewlaps at the throat.




FCI-St. N° 225 / 04.10.2016
BODY: Strong, broad and deep, covered by thick and loose skin.
The thorax is longer than the abdomen.

Topline: Withers, in sloping line, are set well apart from each other
due to the distance between the shoulder blades.  Withers are set
lower than the croup.  After the withers, the upper line changes
direction, ascending smoothly to the croup.  Back line shows no
tendency to sway or roach back.
Loin/Flanks: Shorter and not so deep as the thorax, showing
distinctly the separation of the two component parts.
In females the lower part of the flank is more developed. Seen from
above, the loin is narrower than the thorax and croup but should not
form a waistline.
Croup: Broad, long, sloping at angle of approximately 30 degrees to
the horizontal and ending in a smooth curve. The croup is set a little
higher than the withers.  From a back view, the croup is ample
almost as wide as the chest and can be even broader for females.
Chest: Well-sprung ribs though not interfering with the position of
shoulder. Deep and broad chest reaching to the level of the elbows.
Well-pronounced brisket.
Lower line: A long chest and parallel to the ground in all its
extension.  Slightly tucked up but never whippety.

TAIL: Very wide at the root, medium set, tapering rapidly to reach
the hocks. When the dog is alert, the tail is raised high and the curve
at the extremity is more accentuated.  Should not be carried curled
over the back nor touch it.

### LIMBS



### FOREQUARTERS:


General appearance: The length of the leg, from the ground to the
elbow, should be half of the height from the ground to the withers.



FCI-St. N° 225 / 04.10.2016
Shoulder: The shoulder structure should be composed by two bones
of equal length (scapula and humerus); the former at 45 degrees to
the horizontal and the latter 90 degrees to the scapula.
The scapula-humeral articulation forms the point of shoulder which
is situated at the same level but slightly behind the point of sternum.
In the ideal position, the point of shoulder should be half way from
elbow to withers.  An imaginary perpendicular line coming down
from the withers should cut the elbow and reach the foot.
Forearm: The limbs must be parallel.  Strong and straight bones.
Carpal joint (wrist): Strong and apparent.
Metacarpus (pastern): Short, slightly sloping.
Forefeet: Strong and well-arched toes not too close to each other.
The dog stands on thick toes and pads which are long, broad and
deep. In the correct position, the feet should point forward.  Strong,
dark nails; white nails permissible when the corresponding toes are
white.

### HINDQUARTERS:


General appearance: Less heavy boned than forelegs but never
appearing thin compared to the overall build. Hindlegs are parallel.
Upper thigh: Broad with curved outline shaped by strong muscles
coming from the ilium and ischium which design the curve of the
buttocks and for this reason the ischium must have a good length.
Tarsus (hock): Strong.
Metatarsus (Rear pastern):  Slightly sloping, longer than the
metacarpus.  Moderately angled stifle and hock.
Hind feet: A little more oval than the forefeet but the otherwise
identical. Should not present dewclaws.

GAIT/MOVEMENT: Long and elastic feline-like strides whose
principal characteristic is the pace; a two beat lateral gait in which
the legs of each side move back and forth exactly as a pair (“camel’s
pace”) causing a rolling or rocking motion of the thorax and hips
accentuated by the tail when carried erect.  When walking, it carries
the head lower than the back line.



FCI-St. N° 225 / 04.10.2016
The trot is smooth, free and effortless with a long, powerful and
reaching stride. The gallop is powerful, attaining unsuspected speed
for such a large and heavy dog.
Due to its articulations, typical of molossoids, the movements of the
Fila not only give the impression but actually allow him to make
sudden and rapid changes of direction.

SKIN: One of the most important breed characteristics is the thick,
loose skin over the whole body, chiefly at the neck forming
pronounced dewlaps and many times it can extend to the brisket and
abdomen.  Some individuals present a fold at the sides of the head,
also at the withers running down to the shoulders. If the dog is in
repose, the head should be free from wrinkles.  When alert, the dog
raises its ears and the contraction of the skin on the skull forms small
longitudinal wrinkles between the ears.

### COAT


Hair: Short, smooth, dense and close to the body.

Colour: Brindle, fawn and black. A black mask may or not be
present. In all permitted colours white marks are allowed on the
feet, chest and tip of tail.  White markings on other parts of the coat
are considered a fault.

### SIZE AND WEIGHT:


Height at the withers:
Males:  from 65 cm to 75 cm. Females: from 60 cm to 70 cm.

### Weight


Males: minimum:  50 kg.
Females: minimum:  40 kg.
