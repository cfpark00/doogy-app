### BRACCO ITALIANO


(Italian Pointing Dog)




FCI-St. N° 202  / 17.12.2015

TRANSLATION: Mrs. Peggy Davies. Revised by SABI and Mrs.
Renée Sporre-Willes. Official language (EN).

ORIGIN: Italy.

### DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THE OFFICIAL VALID



### STANDARD: 13.11.2015.



UTILIZATION: Pointing dog.

FCI-CLASSIFICATION: Group  7  Pointing Dogs.

Section 1  Continental pointing dogs,



Type “Braque”.

With working trial.

BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: This dog of ancient Italian
origin used for bird hunting has modelled itself and developed over
the ages; from the hunting of yester years by means of hunt and
shooting.  Frescoes from the 14th century are proof of the
indisputable timelessness of the Italian pointer over the centuries,
regarding his morphology or his hunting aptitudes as a pointing dog.
Selected for great ability in fast and wide trot and by nature an
excellent retriever.

### GENERAL



### APPEARANCE:


Of
strong
and
harmonious
construction, powerful appearance. The preferred subjects are those
with lean limbs, well developed muscles, well defined lines with a
markedly sculpted head and a very obvious lower orbital chiselling,
elements which all contribute to give distinction to this breed.

IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS: Length of the body is the same or
a little more than the height at the withers. Length of head is equal to
4/10 of the height at the withers; its width, measured at the level of
the zygomatic arches, is less than half its length.  Skull and muzzle
are of equal length.



FCI-St. N° 202  / 17.12.2015
BEHAVIOUR/TEMPERAMENT: Tough and adapted to all types
of hunting, reliable, endowed with an excellent ability to understand,
docile and easy to train.

HEAD: Angular and narrow at the level of the zygomatic arches; the
length of the skull equals the length of the muzzle. The upper
longitudinal axes of the skull and muzzle are divergent, i.e. if
extending the top line of the muzzle the latter must emerge in front
of the occipital protuberance, ideally at mid-length of the skull.

### CRANIAL REGION:


Skull: Seen in profile, the skull is in the shape of a very open arch.
Seen from above, it forms lengthwise an elongated ellipse. The width
of the skull, measured at the level of the zygomatic arches, should
not exceed half of the length of the head. The bulge of the forehead
and the supraorbital ridges are perceptible. The frontal groove is
visible and ends at mid-length of the skull. The interparietal crest is
short and not very prominent. The occipital protuberance is
pronounced.
Stop: Not pronounced.

### FACIAL REGION:


Nose: Voluminous, with large well-opened nostrils, protruding
slightly over the lips with which it forms an angle. Colour is more or
less pink – to flesh-coloured or brown, depending on the colour of
the coat.
Muzzle: Either slightly arched or straight. Its length is equal to half
of the length of the head and its depth measures 4/5 of its length.
Seen from the front, the lateral sides of the muzzle converge slightly,
still presenting a foreface of good width. The chin is not very
apparent.
Lips: Upper lips well developed, thin and floppy without being
flaccid, covering the jaw; seen in profile, they overlap the lower jaw
slightly. Seen from the front, they form an inverted « V » below the
nose; the corner of the lips must be marked without being droopy.
Jaws/Teeth: Dental arches well adapted, with the teeth square set to
the jaw; scissor bite. A pincer bite is also acceptable.



FCI-St. N° 202  / 17.12.2015
Cheeks: Lean.

EYES: Semi-lateral position with a soft and submissive expression,
neither deep set nor prominent. Eyes fairly large, eyelids ovalshaped and close fitting (no entropion or ectropion).  The iris is of a
more or less dark ochre or brown colour depending on the coat
colour.

EARS: Long, they should reach the tip of the nose without being
stretched. Their width is at least equal to half their length; raised only
very slightly; base rather narrow, set rather backwards at level of
zygomatic arches; a supple ear with a front rim well turned inwards
and really close to the cheek is appreciated; the tips are slightly
rounded.

NECK: Powerful, in truncated cone shape, length not less than 2/3
of the length of the head, well detached from the nape. The throat
shows a soft double dewlap.

### BODY:


Topline: The topline presents two lines: one, almost straight, slopes
from the withers to the 11th dorsal vertebra; the other is slightly
arched, joining with the line of the rump.
Withers: Well defined, with the points of the shoulder blades well
separated.
Loin: Wide lumbar region, muscled, short and slightly convex.
Croup: Long (about 1/3 of the height at the withers), broad and well
muscled; the ideal pelvic angulation (angle formed by the pelvic
girdle with a horizontal line) is 30°.
Chest: Broad, deep and well let down to the elbows, without forming
a keel, with well-sprung ribs, particularly in the lower part.
Underline and belly: Lower profile almost horizontal along the
ribcage rising slightly at the abdomen.

TAIL: Thick at the base, straight, with a slight tendency to taper;
hair short. When the dog is in action and especially when questing, it
is carried horizontally or nearly. The natural tail should not extend
below the hock and have the above-mentioned features. If docked,


FCI-St. N° 202  / 17.12.2015
for hunting purposes and in compliance with health and animal
welfare, the tail must have a length of 15–25 cm from the root.

### LIMBS



### FOREQUARTERS:


General appearance: Very free in movement.
Shoulder: Strong, well muscled, long and sloping.
Upper arm: Sloping, fitting to the ribcage.
Elbow: The point of the elbow should be on perpendicular line from
the rear point of the shoulder blade to the ground.
Forearm: Strong, straight, with strong and well marked sinews.
Metacarpus (Pastern): Well proportioned, lean, of good length and
slightly sloping.
Forefeet: Strong, slightly oval shaped; well arched with tight toes
and strong nails well curved towards the ground.  Colour of nails is
white, yellow or brown, of a more or less dark shade depending on
the colour of the coat; pads elastic and lean.

### HINDQUARTERS:


Thigh: Long, parallel, muscular, with a rear edge almost straight.
Stifle (Knee): Well angulated.
Lower thigh: Strong.
Hock joint: Broad.
Metatarsus (Rear pastern):  Relatively short and lean.
Hind feet: With all the characteristics of the forefeet: they have
dewclaws, the absence of which is not a fault. Double dewclaw is
tolerated.

GAIT / MOVEMENT: Extended and fast trot, with powerful
propulsion from the hindquarters, head raised and nose held high in
such a way that, when hunting, the nose is higher than the topline.

SKIN: Tough but elastic; finer on the head, the throat, the armpits
and on the lower parts of the body. The visible pigmentation must be
of a corresponding colour with the coat, and never show black spots.


FCI-St. N° 202  / 17.12.2015
The pigmentation of the mouth is pink; in the roans or white and
chestnut coloured dogs they sometimes show brown or pale chestnut
spotting.

### COAT


Hair: Short, dense and glossy, finer and shorter on the head, the ears,
front part of the legs and feet.

Colour:
White. White with patches of varied size of an orange or more or less
dark amber colour. White with more or less large brown patches.
White speckled with pale orange, i.e. orange roan. White speckled
with brown, i.e. liver roan. In this last combination, a metallic sheen
is appreciated, and a warm shade of brown is preferred, recalling the
colour of a monk’s frock.
A symmetrical facial mask is preferred, but the absence of a mask is
tolerated.

### SIZE AND WEIGHT:


Height at the withers:
55 – 67 cm.
Preferred size for males:  58 – 67 cm.
Preferred size for females:  55 – 62 cm.

Weight: Between 25 and 40 kg depending on size.

### FAULTS:


Any departure from the foregoing points should be considered a fault
and the seriousness with which the fault should be regarded should
be in exact proportion to its degree and its effect upon the health and
welfare of the dog and on its ability to perform its traditional work.

### SEVERE FAULTS:


• Accentuated undershot mouth.
• Excessive amount of skin causing an exaggerated dewlap or an

un-divided dewlap and too many wrinkles on the head.
• Size, 2 cm above or below the standard height at the withers.
• An upturned tail is highly undesirable.


FCI-St. N° 202  / 17.12.2015



### DISQUALIFYING FAULTS:


• Aggressive or overly shy dogs.
• Any dog clearly showing physical or behavioural abnormalities.
• Split nose.
• Convergence of cranio-facial axes.
• Overshot mouth.
• Wall eye.
• Coat black, white and black, tricolour, fawn, hazel, unicolour and

tan markings.
• Absence of pigmentation (Albinism).
• Pigmentation of skin and annexes with traces of black.

### N.B.:


• Male animals should have two apparently normal testicles fully

descended into the scrotum.
• Only functionally and clinically healthy dogs, with breed typical

conformation, should be used for breeding.
