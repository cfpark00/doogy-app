BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: The Rottweiler is considered
to be one of the oldest dog breeds. Its origin goes back to Roman
times. These dogs were kept as herder or driving dogs. They
marched over the Alps with the Roman legions, protecting the
humans and driving their cattle. In the region of Rottweil, these dogs
met and mixed with the native dogs in a natural crossing. The main
task of the Rottweiler now became the driving and guarding of the
herds of cattle and the defense of their masters and their property.
This breed acquired its name from the old free city of Rottweil and
was known as the « Rottweil butcher’s dog’ ». The butchers bred this
type of dog purely for performance and usefulness. In due course, a
first rate watch and driving dog evolved which could also be used as
a draught dog. When, at the beginning of the twentieth century,
various breeds were needed for police service, the Rottweiler was
amongst those tested. It soon became evident that the breed was
highly suitable for the tasks set by police service and therefore they
were officially recognized as police dogs in 1910.




FCI-St. N° 147 / 24.07.2018

Rottweiler breeders aim at a dog of abundant strength, black coated
with clearly defined rich tan markings, whose powerful appearance
does not lack nobility, and which is exceptionally well suited to
being a companion, service, rescue and working dog.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: The Rottweiler is a medium to large
size, stalwart dog, neither heavy nor light and neither leggy nor
weedy. His correctly proportioned, compact and powerful build leads
to the conclusion of great strength, agility and endurance.

IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS: The length of the body, measured
from the point of the sternum (breast-bone) to the ischiatic
tuberosity, should not exceed the height at the withers by, at most, 15
%.

BEHAVIOUR / TEMPERAMENT: The Rottweiler is goodnatured, placid in basic disposition, very devoted, obedient, biddable
and eager to work. His appearance is natural and rustic, his
behaviour self-assured, steady and fearless. He reacts to his
surroundings with great alertness and at the same time eventempered.

Skull: Of medium length, relatively broad between the ears.
Forehead line moderately arched as seen from the side. Occipital
bone well developed without being conspicuous.

nostrils, always black.
