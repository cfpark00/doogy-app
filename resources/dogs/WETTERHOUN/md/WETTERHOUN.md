BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: Supposedly brought by
gypsies and / or sailors from countries around the Baltic Sea. In the
19th and 20th century they were used to pull dog carts, but were
mostly used as a hunting dog on the otter and other small predators.
The Wetterhoun was mainly found in water rich areas in Friesland; the
northern part of the Netherlands. In the early 20th century, the
Wetterhoun and the Stabijhoun were regularly crossbred with each
other, threatening to undermine the unique variety of each.

In 1938, a group of enthusiasts of the ‘Kynologenclub Fryslân’ began
purifying the breed again and, in 1942, both breeds were officially
recognized. Important names connected with this process were:
J. Bos, T. van Dijk, B. de Graaf and W. Hoeksema. The first standard
was dated February 10, 1944. The current population (2013) is about
1000 dogs worldwide.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: A simple dog, overall picture square,
powerful build, compact without being heavy or cumbersome.

IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS: The withers height compared to
body length, measured from prosternum to the point of the buttock,
has a ratio of 1: 1 The distance between the withers to the elbow is
equal to the distance from the elbow to the ground.


FCI-St. N°221 / 06.07.2023
BEHAVIOUR/TEMPERAMENT: The Wetterhoun is self-willed
by nature. As a family pet, the Wetterhoun is affectionate. In and
around the house, the Wetterhoun is watchful and keen to catch
vermin. The Wetterhoun can initially be reserved with strangers, but
should not be fearful.

HEAD: Dry.  Size in proportion to the body, robust and powerful.
Must clearly show its gender.  Skull (from stop to occiput) is slightly
longer than the muzzle (from stop to point of nose).

CRANIAL REGION: Shape of skull, direction of axes of skull and
muzzle should be parallel.
Skull: Slightly arched, giving the impression of being broader than
long, gently sloping into the cheeks.
Stop: The transition from skull to muzzle is gradual and only marked
slightly.

### FACIAL REGION:


Nose: Black for dogs with a black basecoat colour.  Brown for dogs
with a brown basecoat colour.  Well developed, with well opened
nostrils.
Muzzle: Broad and firm with a straight nasal bridge.
Lips: Tightly fitting.
Jaws/Teeth: Powerful scissor bite and complete. According to the
teeth formula.
Cheeks: Cheek muscles are moderately developed.

EYES: Medium sized, oval shaped with tight fitting eyelids. The eyes
are placed slightly oblique, which is part of creating a grim expression.
Colour dark brown for dogs with a black base colour and brown for
dogs with a brown base colour.

EARS: Set moderately low. The ear auricle is not too wide open, so
the ears are worn smoothly against the head without a fold. The ears
are moderately long and have the shape of a mason’s trowel.  The hair
of the ear is a typical characteristic of the breed.  It is curled, rather
long at the base of the ear, decreasing in length to the lower 1/3 part
where the ear is covered with short hair.


FCI-St. N°221 / 06.07.2023

Top line: Level.
Withers: Strong, not prominent.
Back: Straight and short.
Loin: Powerful.

smooth lined and the belly moderately tucked up.
