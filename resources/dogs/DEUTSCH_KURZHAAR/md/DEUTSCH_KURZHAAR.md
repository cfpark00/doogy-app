Pointing Dogs.

Dogs « Braque » Type.

With working trial.

BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY:  The history of the German
Shorthaired Pointing Dog starts with the dogs which were used for
the hunt with nets on feathered game, especially in the
Mediterranean countries, and in combination with falconry. Via
France, Spain and Flanders the Pointers came to the German courts.
The most important distinctive feature of these dogs was their
pointing performance. After the first double-barreled gun was made
(1750), a pointing dog was even more required. In full sight of the
dog « game birds in flight » were shot. That was the beginning of the
transition from a mere pointer to a versatile gundog. As a
fundamental basis for the structure and development of the breed the
« Zuchtbuch Deutsch-Kurzhaar » (Studbook) has been published
since 1897. It was Prince Albrecht zu Solms-Braunfeld who
compiled breed characteristics, judging rules for conformation and
finally also simple trial regulations for hunting dogs. Today the
German Shorthaired Pointing Dog still passes through the filter of
elaborated breeding- and trial regulations. The standard stipulates the
consitution of the German Shorthaired Pointing Dog, as a versatile
hunting dog, which enables him to perform all requirements in
connection with hunting activities, even when advanced in age.




FCI-St. N° 119   / 25.04.2001
GENERAL APPEARANCE: A dog of noble and balanced
appearance, the conformation of which ensures strength, endurance
and speed. Proud attitude, smooth outlines, lean head, well carried
tail, firm shiny coat and well reaching, harmonious strides emphasize
its nobility.

IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS: Length of body should slightly
exceed height at withers.

BEHAVIOUR / TEMPERAMENT: Firm, balanced, reliable,
restrained temperament, neither nervous nor shy or aggressive.

HEAD: Lean, well defined, neither too light nor too heavy; as to
strength and length it matches the substance and the sex of the dog.

### CRANIAL REGION:


Skull: Moderately wide, flatly rounded, scarcely pronounced
occipital bone, frontal furrow not too deep, noticeably developed
superciliary ridges.
Stop: Moderately defined.

### FACIAL REGION:


Nose: Somewhat protruding. Nostrils sufficiently wide, broad and
mobile. Basically brown, however black in black or black roan
dogs. A flesh-coloured or spotted nose is only permissible in dogs
with white as basic colour.
Muzzle: Long, broad, deep and strong in order to enable the dog’s
correct carrying of game. Viewed from the side the nasal bridge
shows a slight curvature in all transitions from a nobly constructed
ram’s nose to a slight rise above the straight line - more prominent in
males. A totally straight nasal bridge, although still acceptable, is
less attractive; a concave bridge (dish-face) is a serious fault.
Lips: Tight fitting, not too pendulous, good pigmentation. The nasolabial line slopes almost vertically and then continues in a flat arch to
the moderately pronounced corner of the lips.
Jaws/Teeth: Strong jaws with a perfect, regular and complete scissor
bite. The upper inscisors should reach over the lower incisors


FCI-St. N° 119   / 25.04.2001
without gap and the teeth should be positioned vertically in the jaws.
42 sound teeth, in accordance with the teeth formula.
Cheeks: Strong, well muscled.
EYES: OF medium size, neither protruding nor deep set. The ideal
colour is dark brown. Eyelids tight fitting.

EARS: Moderately long, set on high and broad, flat and without
twisting hanging down close to the head, bluntly rounded at the tip.
Neither too fleshy nor too thin. When brought forward they are
supposed to reach more or less the corner of the lips.

NECK: Length in harmony with general appearance of the dog,
progressively thickening towards the body. Very muscular and
slightly crested nape. Tight fitting skin of throat.

### BODY:


Topline: Straight and slightly sloping.
Withers: Well defined.
Back: Firm and muscular. Vertebral processes should be covered by
muscles.
Loin: Short, broad, muscular, straight or slightly arched. Transition
from back to loin tight and well knit.
Croup: Broad and long enough, not abruptly slanting, but slightly
slanting towards the tail, well muscled.
Chest: Somewhat deeper than broad with well defined forechest,
with the sternum reaching back as far as possible. Sternum and
elbow joint ont the same level. Ribs well sprung, neither flat nor
barrel-shaped. False ribs well reaching down.
Underline and belly: With elegant arch, slightly tucked up towards
rear, dry.

TAIL: Set high, strong at the root and then tapering, of medium
length. About halfway docked for hunting purposes. At rest hanging
down; in movement horizontal, neither carried too high above the
backline nor extremely bent. (In countries where tail docking is
prohibited by law, the tail can remain in its natural shape. It should
reach down as far as the hocks and be carried straight or slightly
sabre tail fashion).


FCI-St. N° 119   / 25.04.2001

FCI-St. N° 119   / 25.04.2001

SKIN: Close and tight, not wrinkly.

### COAT


Hair: Short and dense, rough and hard to the touch. Somewhat
thinner and shorter on the head and ears, not remarkably longer at the
underside of the tail. Should cover the whole body.

Colour:
• Solid brown, without markings.
• Brown with small white or flecked markings at chest and legs.
• Dark brown roan, with brown head, brown patches or specks. The
basic colour of such a dog is not brown mixed with whit or white
with brown, but the coat shows such an even intensive mixture of
brown and white which results in that kind of inconspicuous
exterior of the dog ever so valuable for the practical hunt. At the
inner sides of the hindlegs as well as at the tip of the tail the
colour is often lighter.
• Light brown roan with brown head, brown patches, specks or
without patches. In this colouring the brown hairs are fewer, the
white hairs are predominant.
• White with brown head markings, brown patches or specks.
• Black colour in the same nuances as the brown, respectively the
brown roan colours.
• Yellow tan markings are permissible.
• Blaze, fleck and speckled flews are permissible.

### SIZE:


Height at the withers: Dogs
62 to 66 cm.


Bitches 58 to 63 cm.

FAULTS : Any departure from the foregoing points should be
considered a fault and the seriousness with which the fault should be
regarded should be in exact proportion to its degree and its effect
upon the health and welfare of the dog.
• Faults in attitude, not according or typical to gender.
• Muzzle too short.


FCI-St. N° 119   / 25.04.2001
• Flews too heavy or too thin.
• From the total of 4 PM 1 and 2 M3 only two teeth may be

### SEVERE FAULTS:


• Clumsy, lymphatic, coarse conformation.
• Marked stop.
• Flesh-coloured or flecked nose (except when basic colour of coat
is white).
• Snipy muzzle, concave bridge of the nose (dish-face).
• Pincer bite or partial pincer bite (For dogs older than 4 years a socalled pincer bite due to age shall not affect evaluation as long as
a « Deutsch-Kurzhaar-Club » has certified that at a previous show
a correct bite was confirmed).
• Distinct roach back, slight swayback.
• Considerable lack in depth of chest. Poorly developed forechest.
Ribs too flat or barrel shaped.
• Distinctly turned in or turned out elbows.
• Weak and down on pasterns.
• Pastern totally vertical.

• Distinctly non-typical gender characteristics.
• Absence of more than 2 teeth from the total of 4 PM 1 and 2 M3.
Absence of 1 tooth or more teeth other than PM 1 and M3. Non
visible teeth have to be considered as missing except when
certified by a « Deutsch-Kurzhaar-Club » that at a previous show
or trial their existence was confirmed.
• Overshot and undershot bite, wry mouth as well as all intergrades.
• Any surplus teeth arranged outside the dental arch.
• Cleft palate and hare lip.
• Excessively loose eyelids, ectropion, entropion, distichiasis

### N.B.:


• Male animals should have two apparently normal testicles fully
descended into the scrotum.
