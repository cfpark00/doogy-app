### (EN).



ORIGIN: Sweden.

### DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THE OFFICIAL VALID



### STANDARD:  04.09.2019.



UTILIZATION: Hunting dog. Mainly used for hunting elk, but
also used for hunting bear and boar.

### FCI-CLASSIFICATION:


Group   5  Spitz and primitive type.
Section 2  Nordic Hunting Dogs.
Working trial only for the Nordic
countries (Sweden, Norway and
Finland).

BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: The Jämthund was only
officially recognized in 1946, although it is a very ancient type of
dog that has been known since the North of Sweden was populated.
The reason for the late recognition is that the smaller Norwegian
Elkhound and the Jämthund were judged as the same breed. This
situation eventually turned out to be impossible. The Jämthund is
mainly used for hunting elk but it is also used for bear, boar and
lynx. The breed is expected to, under considerable time intensely,
bay the game which requires dogs with great strength and
endurance.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: Large, rectangular spitz, clean-cut,
strong, substantial but also agile and with a good stature. Body must
not give the impression of being long, nor be too heavy.

BEHAVIOUR / TEMPERAMENT: Courageous and energetic but
also stoically calm.

HEAD: Clean-cut and longish, proportionally broad between the
ears.
