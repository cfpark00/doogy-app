BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: It is believed to descend from
molosser dogs from the Middle East. On account of their size and
courage they were used by tribes whose livelihood depended on
livestock husbandry, thus performing a crucial role for this type of
community.  With the beginning of the transhumance, which implies
temporary displacement of large flocks, it was noticed that they were
exposed to many dangers during their long journeys. On their route
to the mountains in the summer and back to the plains in the winter,
flocks were always accompanied by large dogs, which lead to the
latter being spread along the route from region to region. Thus, is
explained the appearance of this powerful dog, in the Alentejo
plains, which has been called Rafeiro do Alentejo since the end of
the 19th century.
