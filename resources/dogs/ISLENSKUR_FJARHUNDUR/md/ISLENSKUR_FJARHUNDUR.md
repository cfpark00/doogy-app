BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: The Icelandic Sheepdog is
Iceland’s native breed of dog. It is the descendant of the dogs
brought to Iceland by the original Viking settlers (AD 870-930).
The dogs became indispensable in the rounding up of livestock and
in the daily work on the farms. Their method of working adapted to
the local terrain, farming methods and the people’s hard struggle for
survival over the centuries.

Herding Spitz, slightly under medium size, sturdy, with erect ears
and a curled tail. Seen from the side the dog is rectangular. The

bearing is typical for the breed. There are two types of coat, short
and long, both thick and very weather-resistant. There is a marked
difference in appearance between the sexes.

On grey shaded dogs and quite often on fawn and red dogs a
dark mask, dark tips to the outer hairs and dark hairs in the coat
occur (dark overlay/sable).
Black and chocolate brown dogs most often have traditional tan
markings in any of the various fawn colours on the cheeks, over
the eyes (eyebrows), below the tail, on the underside of the tail
and on the legs.
Pied dogs have patches of colour on the body on a white
background, and can also have the accompanying white
