### MASTÍN DEL PIRINEO


(Pyrenean Mastiff)




FCI-St. N° 92  / 30.08.2002
TRANSLATION: Mrs. C. Seilder.  Official language (ES).

ORIGIN: Spain.

### DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THE OFFICIAL VALID



### STANDARD: 26.05.1982.



UTILIZATION: Guard and defense.  Previously, the Pyrenean
Mastiff was used for defense against beasts of prey, in particular
against wolf and bear.  Nowadays he is an excellent guard for
country estates and their owners as he is easily trained.

### FCI-CLASSIFICATION:


Group 2
Pinscher
and
Schnauzer-
Molossoid
breeds
–
Swiss
Mountain and Cattle
Dogs.

Section 2.2 Molossoid breeds,
Mountain type.

Without working trial.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: That of a very large dog, above
average size and of medium proportions.  Harmonious, emphatically
strong and muscular.  Firm bone structure.  Coat not exaggerated in
length.  In spite of his size, must not give the impression of being
heavy or sluggish.


IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS: Within medium proportions.
•
Well balanced and harmonious over.  The length of the body
measures barely more than the height at withers.
•
Length of skull in relation to bridge of nose = 5 : 4.
•
Breadth of skull: Equal to or slightly larger than length.
•
Relationship of height at withers to girth of chest is
approximately 7: 10.




FCI-St. N° 92  / 30.08.2002
BEHAVIOUR / TEMPERAMENT: Friendly towards humans,
calm, noble and very intelligent, at the same time courageous and
proud towards strangers from whom he never backs away.  In his
behaviour towards other dogs, he is good natured and aware of his
superior strength.  Occasionally, he will fight with great skill, an
atavistic quality which goes back to hundreds of years of fighting
wolves.  His dark bark comes from deep within his chest.  His
expression is alert.

HEAD: Large, strong, moderately long.  Length of skull is 5 : 4 in
proportion to bridge of nose.  Longitudinal axes of skull and muzzle
are very slightly diverging to almost parallel.  Seen from above, skull
and muzzle must be long and even in shape without marked
difference between width at set-on of muzzle and width at temple.
Seen from side, head must be deep and not bulging.

### CRANIAL REGION:


Skull: Broad, strong, slightly convex in profile.  Width of skull equal
to or slightly broader than length.  Occipital bone pronounced.
Stop: Gentle, barely emphasized, but still visible.

### FACIAL REGION:


Nose leather: Black, moist, large and broad.
Muzzle:  Seen from side, bridge of nose must be straight.  Seen from
above, the muzzle is slightly triangular, tapering very gradually from
its set on to the nose leather, without, however, getting pointed.
Lips: The upper lip should cover the lower without any hint of
slackness.  The lower lip forms a marked labial corner.  Mucous
membranes should be black.
Jaws/Teeth: Scissor bite.  Teeth white, strong and healthy.  Canines:
large, long, pointed, well adapted to each other, so as to be able to
catch any prey.  Molars: large and strong.  Incisors: rather small.  All
premolars should be present.  Gums black with pronounced
transverse membraneous ridges.




FCI-St. N° 92  / 30.08.2002
EYES: Small, almond shaped, hazel colour.  Dark eyes preferred.
Expression is alert, noble, sympathetic, and intelligent, but can be
extraordinarily stern towards an opponent. Eye lids: black
pigmented. When dog is alert, lids fitting close to eyeball are
preferred.  In repose, a slight slackness of the lower lid, which shows
a small stripe of conjunctiva, is typical of the breed.

EARS: Medium size, triangular, hanging flat.  Set on above line of
eyes.  In repose, hanging close to cheeks.  When dog is alert, clearly
standing away from cheeks. One third of the upper and rear part
should be slightly pricked.  Ears should not be cropped.

NECK: Should be the shape of a blunt cone, broad, strong, muscular
and flexible.  Skin thick and slightly loose.  Distinct double dewlap,
well formed, yet not exaggerated.

### BODY:


General impression: Rectangular, powerful and robust, giving the
impression of great strength, yet supple and agile.
Upperline: Straight, horizontal standing and moving.
Withers: Well pronounced.
Back: Strong and muscular.
Loins: Long, broad and strong, gradually getting narrower towards
the flanks.
Croup: Wide and strong.  Compared to the horizontal its inclination
is 45°. Height at rump equal to height at withers.
Chest: Broad, deep, muscular, and powerful.  Point of sternum
protruding.  Ribs spaced widely apart with rounded ribcage, not flat.
Proportion of height at withers to girth of chest: approximately 7 :
10.
Underline and belly: Belly moderately tucked up.  Groin deep, flanks
very broad.

TAIL: Set on medium high.  Thick at root, strong and flexible.  The
coat on tail is definitely long, soft and forms a beautiful plume.  In
repose it hangs low and reaches easily to the hocks.


FCI-St. N° 92  / 30.08.2002
The last third is always lightly curved.  In movement and when the
dog is alert, it is carried in sabre form with definite hook at tip but
without the entire length being bent or resting over the back.

### LIMBS



### FOREQUARTERS:


General appearance: Seen from the front, absolutely vertical, straight
and parallel.  Muscles and sinews clearly visible.  Length of forearm
three times length of pastern.  Good strength of bone, strong pastern.
Shoulders: Well muscled.  Shoulderblade sloping, longer than
forearm.  Angle of shoulderblade to upper arm approximately 100°.
Upper arm: Very strong.
Elbows: Very bony, close fitting to ribcage.  Angle of upper arm to
forearm approximately 125°.
Forearm: Bone sturdy, straight and strong.
Pastern: Seen from side, slightly sloping, practically in continuation
of forearm.
Front feet: Cat feet.  Toes tight with strong, well arched toe bones.
Nails and pads strong and robust.  Skin between toes moderately
developed, hairy.

### HINDQUARTERS:


General appearance: Powerful, muscular.  Adequate angulations,
seen from the side.  Seen from rear and side, limbs are vertical.
Hocks straight and vertical.  Hindquarters must have the ability to
provide with ease forceful drive with elegance.
Upper thigh: Strong and muscular.  Hip joint angle approximately
100 degrees.
Stifle:  Angulation from upper upper to lower thigh approximately
120°.
Lower thigh: Long, well muscled, and good strength of bone.
Hock: Angle open, approximately 130 degrees.
Hind pastern: Well defined with clearly visible Achilles tendon.
Dewclaws, either single or double, are either present or missing.
Their removal is permitted.  In dogs of equal quality, double
dewclaws are preferred.



FCI-St. N° 92  / 30.08.2002
Hind feet:  Cat feet of light oval shape, slightly longer than front feet.

GAIT / MOVEMENT: Preferred movement is the trot which should
be harmonious, strong, and elegant.  No tendency for legs to swing
outward.  No pacing.

SKIN: Elastic, thick, pink in colour, with dark pigmented patches.
All mucous membranes should be black.

### COAT



Hair: Dense, thick and of moderate length.  The ideal medium length,
measured on middle section of topline, should be 6 to 9 cm.  The
coat is longer on the shoulders, neck, under belly, at the back of legs
as well as on the tail.  On the plume, the texture is not as bristly as
elsewhere on the body.  The coat should bristly, not woolly in
texture.

Colour: Basic colour white, always with a well-defined mask.
Sometimes there are irregularly distributed distinctly outlined
patches of the same colour as the mask. Tricolour or pure white dogs
are undesirable.  Ears always spotted.  Tip of tail and lower parts of
legs are always white.  Mask should be clearly defined.  It is an
advantage if the outline of the patches is clear cut.  At the roots, the
coat should be as light as possible, ideally really white.  The most
desired colours are, in order of preference, pure white (snow-white),
patches medium grey, intensive golden yellow, brown, black, greysilver, light beige, sandy or marbled.  Undesirable are red patches
and yellowish-white basic colour.

SIZE: There is no upper height limit.  When quality is equal, the
bigger dog is always preferred.
Lower limit:  Dogs:
77 cm.

Bitches: 72 cm.
It is, however, desirable that all dogs should exceed the lower limit
considerably.  Dogs should be above 81 cm, bitches 75 cm.




FCI-St. N° 92  / 30.08.2002
