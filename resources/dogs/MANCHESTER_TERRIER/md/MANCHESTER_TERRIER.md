Terriers.

Without working trial.

BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: His name denotes his origin,
and it is likely that there is some Whippet in his ancestry. Elegant
and graceful, he was bred as a ratter and can still be relied upon to
despatch vermin quickly and efficiently.
Rat killing reached its peak in the mid-1800s and what dog shows
there were, at that time, were usually held in public houses. In
Manchester, especially, these became a weekly feature and soon
this terrier had classes of his own, eventually taking the name
Manchester Terrier.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: Compact, elegant and sound with
substance.

BEHAVIOUR AND TEMPERAMENT: Keen, alert, gay and
sporting; discerning and devoted.
