GENERAL APPEARANCE: The Westphalian Dachsbracke is the
short-legged variety of the German Hound (Bracke).  It corresponds
in essential points with the longlegged variety, but gives a
compacter, more powerful impression than the former. The
Westphalian Dachsbracke is a moderately long, sturdily built,
hunting dog, standing 30-38 cm high, with noble head of medium
size andwell set on tail which, in quiet movement, is carried upwards
in sabre shape or pendant with slight curve at the tip.  Facial
expression is faithful, friendly, serious and alert.

HEAD: Seen from the front, the head appears, as with the German
Hound, narrow and elongated.  The occiput protrudes only slightly.

### CRANIAL REGION:


Skull: The skull is only marginally broader than the cheeks.
Stop: Minimal.

### FACIAL REGION:


Nose: The leather has a light, almost flesh coloured strip over the
center, while the nose wings have more or less dark pigment.
Muzzle: Bridge of nose slightly arched.
Lips: Moderately overlapping.


FCI-St. N° 100 / 06.05.1997
Jaws/Teeth: Dentition extremely strong and even.  Incisors are either
level (level bite) or the inside of the upper incisors may rub against
the outside of the lower incisors (scissor bite).  The canines are
specially strongly developed.  The fold of the mouth is small.

EYES: Dark, clear, with friendly expression.

EARS: Leathers of medium length, broad, close fitting, blunty
rounded at tips.

NECK: Moderately long.  Rather thick in relation to the head but
getting gradually finer towards head.  The skin of the neck is loose
but without forming a dewlap.

### BODY:


Back: Slightly arched, medium length, with slight dip behind
shoulders.
Loin: Broad, strongly developed.
Croup: Falls away obliquely.
Chest: Narrower than with the Dachshund, strongly supported by the
forelegs; should not too much let down between these.  Ribcage
long.
Underline and belly: Slight tuck up in belly towards hindquarters.

TAIL: Set on relatively high.  The set of merges with the spine
without forming any sharp angle.  Very thick at root.  The underside
is bristly, the upper side has smooth hair and comes to a bristly tip
without any tuft.

### LIMBS



### FOREQUARTERS:


General appearance: Well developed, clean, heavy boned and
sinewy.  Front legs seen from front not bowed but straight with feet
pointing forward.
Elbows: Close fitting.
Forefeet: Sturdy with tight short toes.



FCI-St. N° 100 / 06.05.1997



### HINDQUARTERS:


General appearance: Straighter than with most other breeds. Hind
legs are far more strongly developed in relation to forelegs than with
the Dachshound.
Upper Thighs: They have strong pronounced muscles, and, seen both
from side and rear, stand almost straight.
Hind feet: Sturdy with tight short toes.

### COAT


Hair: The whole body, including the underside, with a very dense
and coarse coat.  Short on head, leathers and lower part of legs,
longer over back, neck and underside of tail.

« Bracken » markings : Blaze or snip, white muzzle and white collar,
white chest, legs and tip of tail .  Undesirable are bicoloured dogs as
well as dogs with black markings on head.  Chocolate brown is a
fault.

FAULTS : Any departure from the foregoing points should be
considered a fault and the seriousness with which the fault should be
regarded should be in exact proportion to its degree and its effect
upon the health and welfare of the dog.

abnormalities.
