FCI-St. N° 182  / 18.04.2007
TRANSLATION: Mrs C. Seidler.  Official language (DE).

COUNTRY OF ORIGIN: Germany.

### DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THE OFFICIAL VALID



### STANDARD: 06.03.07.



UTILISATION: Watch and Companion Dog.

FCI-CLASSIFICATION:  Group 2
Pinscher and Schnauzer-


Molossoid breeds - Swiss


Mountain and Cattle Dogs.

Section 1 Pinscher
and
Schnauzer
type.

Without working trial.

BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: Originally the Schnauzer was
used in the region of Southern Germany as a stable dog as he felt
particularly at home in the company of horses. He eagerly watched
out for all rodents in order to kill them in a flash. This very early got
him the appellation of “Rattler” (ratter). When the PinscherSchnauzer-Club was founded in 1895, he was entered under the
name “rough haired Pinscher”.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: Medium sized, strong, stocky rather
than slim, rough haired.

### IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS:


•
Square build in which the height at the withers is nearly equal to
the body length.
•
The length of the head (measured from the tip of the nose to the
occiput) corresponds to half the length of the topline (measured
from the withers to the set on of the tail).




FCI-St. N° 182  / 18.04.2007
BEHAVIOUR/TEMPERAMENT: Typical characteristics are his
lively temperament, coupled with placid composure. Typical are his
good nature, his playfulness, and his proverbial devotion to his
master. He loves children, is incorruptible, alert, yet not noisy.
Highly
developed
sense
organs,
intelligence,
trainability,
fearlessness, endurance and resistance to weather and diseases
provide the Schnauzer with all the requirements to be an outstanding
family, guard and companion dog, also endowed with the qualities of
a working dog.

### HEAD



### CRANIAL REGION


Skull: Strong, long without markedly protruding occiput. The head
should be in keeping with the dog’s force. The forehead is flat,
without wrinkling and parallel to the bridge of nose.
Stop: Appears well defined due to the brows.

### FACIAL REGION



Nose:
Well developed nose leather with large nostrils, always
black.
Muzzle: Ending in a blunt wedge. Bridge of nose straight.
Lips: Black, smooth, and tight-fitting to the jaws. Corners of lips
closed.
Jaws/Teeth: Strong upper and lower jaw.  The complete scissor bite
(42 pure white teeth according to the dentition formula), is strongly
developed and firmly closing. The chewing muscles are strongly
developed but the cheeks must not interfere with the rectangular
shape of the head (with the beard).

EYES: Medium sized, oval, facing forward, dark with lively
expression. Eyelids close fitting.

EARS: Drop ears, set high, V-shaped with inner edges  lying close to
the cheeks, evenly carried , turned forward towards temples.  Folds
parallel, should not be above the top of the skull.




FCI-St. N° 182  / 18.04.2007

NECK: The strong, muscular neck is nobly arched, blending
smoothly into the withers. Strongly set on, slim, nobly curved,
corresponding to the dog’s force. Throat skin tight- fitting without
folds.

### BODY


Topline: Slightly sloping from withers towards rear.
Withers: Forming the highest point in topline.
Back: Strong, short and taut.
Loins: Short, strong and deep. The distance from the last rib to the
hip is short to make the dog appear compact.
Croup: Slightly rounded, imperceptibly blending into tail set on.
Chest: Moderately broad, oval in diameter, reaching to the elbows.
The forechest is distinctly marked by the point of the sternum.
Underline and belly: Flanks not too tucked up, forming a well curved
line with the underside of the ribcage.

TAIL: Natural; a sabre or sickle carriage is sought after.

### LIMBS



### FOREQUARTERS:


General appearance: Seen from the front, the front legs are strong,
straight, and not close together.  Seen from the side, the forearms are
straight.
Shoulders: The shoulder blade lies close against the rib cage and is
well muscled on both sides of the shoulder bone, protruding over the
points of the thoracic vertebrae. As sloping as possible and well laid
back, forming an angle of appr. 50° to the horizontal.
Upper arm: Lying close to the body, strong and well-muscled,
forming an angle of 95° to 105° to the shoulder blade.
Elbows: Close fitting, turning neither in nor out.
Forearm: Viewed from all sides completely straight, strongly
developed, and well-muscled.
Carpal joint: Strong, firm, barely standing out against the structure of
the forearm.



FCI-St. N° 182  / 18.04.2007
Pastern: Seen from the front, vertical. Seen from the side slightly
sloping towards the ground, strong and slightly springy.
Forefeet: Short and round. Toes well-knit and arched (cat foot) with
short dark nails and resistant pads.

### HINDQUARTERS:


General appearance: Standing obliquely when seen from the side,
standing parallel but not close together when seen from the rear.
Upper thigh: Moderately long, broad and strongly muscled.
Stifle: Turning neither in nor out.
Lower thigh: Long, strong and sinewy, running into a strong hock.
Hock: Very well angulated, strong, firm, turning neither in nor out.
Metatarsus: Short, vertical to the ground.
Hind feet: Toes short, arched and well-knit. Nails short and black.

GAIT/MOVEMENT: Flexible, elegant, agile, free and ground
covering. The front legs swinging as far forward as possible, the hind
legs, ground covering and springy, provide the necessary drive. The
front leg of one side and the hind leg of the other side move forward
at the same time. The back, the ligaments and the joints are firm.

SKIN: Tight fitting over the whole body.

### COAT



Hair:  The coat should be wiry, harsh, and dense. It consists of a
dense undercoat and a not too short top coat, lying close to the body.
The top coat is rough and sufficiently long to allow the checking of
its texture; it is neither bristly nor wavy. The hair on the limbs tends
to be less harsh. Coat short on forehead and ears.   Typical
characteristics are the not too soft beard on the muzzle and the bushy
eyebrows which slightly shade the eyes.

Colour:
•
Pure black with black undercoat.
•
Pepper and Salt.



FCI-St. N° 182  / 18.04.2007
When breeding Pepper and Salt, the aim is a medium shading with
evenly distributed, well pigmented pepper colouring and grey
undercoat.
The shades from dark iron grey to silver grey are all permitted. In all
colour variations there must be a dark mask which should adapt
harmoniously to the respective colour, emphasizing the expression.
Distinct light markings on head, chest and limbs are undesirable.

Height at withers: Dogs and bitches: 45 to 50 cm
Weight:                 Dogs and bitches: 14 to 20 kg.
