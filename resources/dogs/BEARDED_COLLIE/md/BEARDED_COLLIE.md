BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: There is mention of a breed
resembling the Bearded Collie in Scottish records dating back to
around the sixteenth century. He has long been known in
Scotland and Northern England where he was bred for herding
sheep. Some five hundred years ago dogs, which were also said to
be the forerunners of the Polish Lowland Sheepdog were
abandoned on the shores of Scotland and these bred with native
herding dogs. A look at the Polish Lowland will show similarities.
But the Bearded Collie as we know it today owes most of what we
have to G Olive Willison who, in the 1940s, came into possession
of a Beardie puppy called Jeannie. After searching she found a
mate for Jeannie, a dog called Bailey, and her Bothkennar
kennels set the mould for today’s Bearded Collies.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: Lean, active dog. Though strongly
made, should show plenty of daylight under body and should not look
too heavy. Bright, enquiring expression is a distinctive feature.

IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS: Longer than it is high in an
approximate proportion of 5 to 4 measured from point of chest to
point of buttock. Bitches may be slightly longer. Distance between
stop and occiput should be equal to width between orifices of ears.



FCI-St. N° 271  / 12.05.2015
BEHAVIOUR/TEMPERAMENT: Alert, lively, self-confident and
active. Steady, intelligent working dog, with no signs of nervousness
or aggression.

HEAD:  In proportion to size. Whole effect being that of a dog with
strength of muzzle and plenty of brain room.

### CRANIAL REGION:


Skull: Broad, flat and square.
Stop: Moderate.

### FACIAL REGION:


Nose: Large and square, generally black but normally following coat
colour in blues and browns. Nose of solid colour without spots or
patches.
Muzzle: Strong and equal in length to distance between stop and
occiput.
Lips: Of solid colour without spots or patches. Pigmentation follows
nose colour.
Jaws/teeth: Teeth large and white. Jaws strong with a perfect, regular
and complete scissor bite preferred, i.e. upper teeth closely
overlapping lower teeth and set square to the jaws. Level bite
tolerated but undesirable.

EYES: Toning with coat colour, set widely apart and large, soft and
affectionate, not protruding. Pigmentation of eye rims follows nose
colour. Eyebrows arched up and forward but not so long as to
obscure eyes.

EARS: Of medium size and drooping. When alert, ears lift at base,
level with, but not above top of skull, increasing apparent breadth of
skull.

NECK: Moderate length, muscular and slightly arched.

loin.

FCI-St. N° 271  / 12.05.2015


### COAT


Hair: Double with soft, furry and close undercoat. Outer coat flat,
harsh, strong and shaggy, free from woolliness and curl, though
slight wave permissible.
Length and density of hair sufficient to provide a protective coat and
to enhance shape of dog, but not enough to obscure natural lines of
body. Coat must not be trimmed in any way. Bridge of nose sparsely
covered with hair slightly longer on side just to cover lips. From
cheeks, lower lips and under chin, coat increases in length towards
chest, forming typical beard.

Colour: Slate grey, reddish-fawn, black, blue, all shades of grey,
brown and sandy with or without white markings. Never
merle/dapple. When white occurs it appears on foreface, as a blaze
on skull, on tip of tail, on chest, legs and feet and, if round the collar,
roots of white hair should not extend behind shoulder. White should
not appear above hocks on outside of hindlegs. Slight tan markings
are acceptable on eyebrows, inside ears, on cheeks, under root of tail
and on legs where white joins main colour.

### SIZE AND WEIGHT:


Ideal height at withers:  Males
53– 56cm.

Females  51–53 cm.
Overall quality and proportions should be considered before size but
excessive variations from the ideal height should be discouraged.

FAULTS: Any departure from the foregoing points should be
considered a fault and the seriousness with which the fault should be
regarded should be in exact proportion to its degree and its effect
upon the health and welfare of the dog and its ability to perform its
traditional work.

### DISQUALIFYING FAULTS :


•
Aggressive or overly shy dogs.
•
Any dog clearly showing physical or behavioural
abnormalities.



FCI-St. N° 271  / 12.05.2015

Male animals should have two apparently normal testicles fully

descended into the scrotum.
•
Only functionally and clinically healthy dogs, with breed typical

conformation should be used for breeding.
