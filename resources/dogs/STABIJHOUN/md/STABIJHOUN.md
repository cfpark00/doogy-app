BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: The Stabijhoun is related to
the Drentsche Patrijshond and Heidewachtel. The Stabijhoun
probably owes its name to its versatility. The word Stabijhoun is
derived from the words ‘sta mij bij’ or ‘stand by me’, while Houn is
the Frisian word for dog and is pronounced "hoon". The Stabijhoun
originates in the Frisian forest area. In the early 20th century
Stabijhoun and Wetterhoun were regularly crossbred with each
other. Thereby, the unique varieties of each were threatened to be
lost.  In 1938 a group of enthusiastic people of the Kynologenclub
Friesland started purifying the two breeds again and in 1942 both
breeds were officially recognized. Important names in this process
were:  J. Bos, T. van Dijk, B. de Graaf and W. Hoeksema. The first
standard was dated February 10, 1944. In 1947, the Dutch
Association
for
Stabij
and
Wetterhounen


### (NVSW)


was
established. The NVSW represents the interests of The Frisian
Breeds since 1947. The population of the Stabijhoun is currently
(2013) more than 6000 dogs worldwide.




FCI-St. N° 222 / 29.05.2015
GENERAL APPEARANCE: Functional and powerful built
pointing dog. The body is slightly longer than its height at the
withers. The overall picture is neither too robust nor too fine. The
skin should fit tightly. The feathering on chest, collar, forelegs,
trousers and tail gives the Stabijhoun the impression of being
longhaired, but the coat should not be excessively long. Sexual
dimorphism should be unmistakable.

IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS: The body is slightly longer than
its height at the withers.  It is important that the harmony and balance
associated with a functional body is in accordance with the size of
the dog. Elbow is approximately equidistant from ground to withers.

BEHAVIOUR/TEMPERAMENT: The Stabijhoun guard the yard
and keeps it free of mice and rats. The previously common larger
type Stabijhoun pulled the milk carts, while the smaller type made
his name as a professional mole catcher. This talent made the
Stabijhoun popular with the poorer farmers and farmhands. The
moleskins were worth a lot of money as linings for the wrists of
sleeves and other items. The Stabijhoun was carried in a basket on
the bike so that they could cover long distances. The Stabijhoun is
very independent and likes to go his own way. The Stabijhoun is
affectionate but can also be very headstrong. Patience and a
consistent education are essential. In the house or in the yard, the
Stabijhoun is a quiet but vigilant dog. With strangers or in unfamiliar
situations, Stabijhoun may be reserved at first, but should not be
afraid.

### HEAD


Dry, without pendulous lips or dewlap. The size of the head is in
proportion to the body and sexual dimorphism should be clearly
defined. The head exhibits more length than width. The length of the
muzzle, measured from the nose to the stop is approximately equal to
the length from the stop to the occiput. The expression is gentle,
friendly and attentive.




FCI-St. N° 222 / 29.05.2015


### CRANIAL REGION:


Skull: The skull is slightly rounded and also slightly rounded on the
sides, not narrow, but should not give the impression of being broad
or round.
Stop: The skull is sloping gradually to the foreface. Seen from the
side, the stop seams more marked due to the developed brows.

### FACIAL REGION:


Nose: Black in dogs with a black and white coat colour. Brown in
dogs with a brown and white coat colour. Nose well developed with
wide-open nostrils.
Muzzle: Strong, tapering gradually to the nose tip, without being
snipy, viewed both from above and from the side (wedge
shaped). The nasal bridge is straight and broad, and viewed from the
side neither concave nor convex.
Lips: Tightly fitting, not pendulous and not showing labial folds.
Jaws/Teeth: Powerful and complete. Scissor bite. Missing PM1 or
M3 is allowed, as is also a duplicate PM1.
Cheeks: Barely pronounced.

EYES: Set horizontally. Medium sized, slightly rounded shape with
close fitting eyelids, without a visible conjunctiva. The pigment of
the iris is dark brown for dogs with black and white coat and a lighter
brown colour for dogs with a brown and white coat colour.

EARS: The ears are set in an imaginary line drawn from the nose tip
through the inside corner of the eyes. When attentive, the ears should
not protrude beyond the outline of the skull. The ear auricle is not
strongly developed, so the ears are worn smoothly lying against the
head. They are moderately long, reaching to the corner of the mouth,
and have the shape of a trowel that is not round, but ends in a
rounded point. The hair of the ear is a typical feature; at the base of
the ear it is quite long then decreases in length gradually with the
lower third of the ear being covered with short hair. The hair should
be straight, but slightly wavy is allowed.  Hair on the ears should not
reach longer than the ear itself as it gives an untidy appearance.




FCI-St. N° 222 / 29.05.2015

NECK: Strong and rounded, of medium length, but not too long. The
neck runs smoothly with a blunt angle to the back line, so that the
head is usually carried low. The neck shows no throatiness or
dewlap.

BODY: Powerful, clean cut and well muscled.
Top line: Smooth and strong topline.
Withers: Far enough back, strong, but not prominent
Back: Strong and straight.
Loin: Strong and muscular.
Croup: Slightly sloping.
Chest: Deep, reaching to the elbows. Viewed from the front rather
broad, so that the forelegs are set wide apart.  Ribs well sprung but
not barreled. The ribs are deep and long, so the ribcage extends as far
back as possible. Elbows must be tight to the chest.
Underline and belly: Smooth and reaching far enough to the rear.
The belly only slightly tucked up.

TAIL: Length reaching to the hock joint. Not set high. The tail is
usually worn down although the last third of the tail may turn up
during rest or at a stand.  During movement the tail lifts, but should
never be worn on or over the back or in a spiral. The tail is round and
covered up to the tip with long, dense hair, without curls, waves, or
feathering. Instead, the tail has a bushy structure, so the hair around
is generously long and thick, giving a full and rich appearance.

### LIMBS



### FOREQUARTERS:


General appearance: Powerful, muscular and functionally angulated,
so the legs are correctly under the body. Forelegs seen from the front
standing a bit wide.
Shoulder: Shoulder blade close to the chest/body and well laid back.
Upper arm: Functionally angulated. Length is equal to or only
slightly shorter than the length of the shoulder blade.
Elbow: Strong, straight and parallel.
Forearm: Strong, straight and parallel.


FCI-St. N° 222 / 29.05.2015

Forefeet: Strong, compact and slightly oval shaped. Toes well
arched, closed and facing forward.

### GAIT / MOVEMENT:


Powerful, harmonious, with good drive and covering a lot of ground.
Viewed front on the Stabijhoun moves a bit broad. During
movement, the head is carried low. The tail is carried above the
topline with a slight bow during action.

SKIN: Firm, well fitting, without wrinkles or folds

### COAT


Hair: The coat is of medium length and straight on the body with a
weather-resistant undercoat. At the most, a slightly wavy coat is
tolerated on the croup. With the bushy hair on the chest, collar,
trousers and tail, the coat gives the impression of being
longhaired. Coat on the head, the front of the forelegs, and on the
front of the hocks is short. The hair on the back of the front legs is
longer and well developed. On the trousers and the tail, the hair is
bushy rather than feathered.  A curly coat is not allowed.




FCI-St. N° 222 / 29.05.2015
Colour: The Stabijhoun is a pied dog in black or brown with white
markings, but also black or brown roans are accepted. The white may
have roaning or ticking. The head is black or brown, with or without
a blaze. Both of these colours occur with or without plates. Coats
with a (distinct) saddle are tolerated. Tan marking or tricolor is
disqualifying.

### SIZE AND WEIGHT:


Ideal height at the withers:  Males:
50–53 cm.

Females:  48–50 cm.
2 cm above and 2 cm below the ideal size is allowed. Breed type is
more important than exact measurements.

Weight:


Males: 22–27 kg. Females: 18–23 kg.

FAULTS: Any departure from the foregoing points should be

traditional work.
