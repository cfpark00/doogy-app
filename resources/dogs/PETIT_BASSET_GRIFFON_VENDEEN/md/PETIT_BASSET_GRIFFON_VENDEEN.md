### PETIT BASSET GRIFFON VENDEEN




FCI-St. N° 67 / 14.02.2001
TRANSLATION: John Miller and Raymond Triquet.  Official
language (FR).

ORIGIN : France.

### DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THE OFFICIAL VALID



### STANDARD: 09.01.1999.



UTILIZATION: Devil in the country, angel in the house, that’s our
Basset.  It’s a passionate hunter, that must, from an early age, get
used to obeying. Perfect assistant to the hunter with a gun on
territories of medium size, specialist for rabbit, but no other game
escapes from it.

### FCI-CLASSIFICATION:


Group 6
Scenthounds and related



breeds.



Section 1.3 Small-sized Hounds.

With working trial.



BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: For a long time the Petit
Basset Griffon Vendéen had the same standard as the Grand Basset,
only the size was different (from 34 to 38 cm).  The result in
utilization was not very brilliant, because they were semi-crooked
and as heavy as the Grand Basset.  That is why that M.Abel Dezamy
created a separate standard for them.  To define this hound, let us
remember what Paul Daubigné wrote : « It is no longer a small
Vendéen by simple reduction of the height, but a small Basset
harmoniously reduced in all his proportions and in its volume, that is
naturally endowed with all the moral qualities which presuppose the
passion for hunting ».  A team of Petit Bassets won the first edition
of France’s Cup on rabbit.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: Small, active and vigorous hound,
with a slightly elongated body.  Proud tail carriage.  Coat hard and
long without exaggeration.  Expressive head; leathers well turned
inwards, covered with long hair and set below the level of the eye,
not too long.
