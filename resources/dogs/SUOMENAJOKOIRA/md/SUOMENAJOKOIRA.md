### DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THE OFFICIAL VALID



### STANDARD: 17.07.1997.



UTILIZATION: A hound for hunting hare and fox by following the

resonant barking.

### FCI-CLASSIFICATION:


Group 6
Scenthounds and related


breeds.

Section 1.2. Medium sized hounds.

With working trial.

BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY:  In Finland in the beginning
of 19th century there were in addition to the finnish country dogs also
many dogs resembling the European hound breeds.  After the
establishment of the Finnish Kennel Club in 1889 the development
of the Finnish Hound began.  The first standard was written in 1932.
The breeding associations in different parts of the country were very
important to the development of the breed.  The crosses made in the
beginning of the 20Th century have also helped to create the stock
from which the Finnish Hound descends.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: Tricoloured, medium in size, evenly
high; clearly longer in body than the height at the withers, strongly
built but not heavy.  The supporting area of standing is as long as the
body or slightly longer, in front it is as broad as the chest and in rear
at least as broad as in the front.  The sex should be clearly stamped.

### IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS:


• The ratio between the length of the body and the height at the
withers is of 1,1 to 1.
• The depth of the chest is a half of the height at the withers.
• The length of the muzzle is equal to the length of the skull.  The
length of the skull is equal to its width and depth.
