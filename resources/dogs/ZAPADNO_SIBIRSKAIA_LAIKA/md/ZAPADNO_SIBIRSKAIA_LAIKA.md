With working trial.

### BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY:


This native Russian hunting breed comes from to the Ural, West and
East Siberia forest area and was selected from Khanty and Manci
hunting dogs. In the beginning of the 20th century the first standards
of Vogul (Mansi) and Ostyak (Khanty) Laikas were created by
Russian cynologists. In 1947 the new qualification of Laika breeds
was offered and closely related Khanty and Mansi off-springs were
united into one breed. The new breed standard for ZapadnoSibirskaya Laika was approved in 1952.
Nowadays Zapadno-Sibirskaya Laika is the most prevalent hunting
breed in Russia and widely spread in all wooden areas of the country
from Karelia to Kamchatka. The breed seems to be especially
popular in its native/original areas. Foundation stock from kennels of
dogs with stable inheritance of work and well established quality in
type and ability to work has been introduced in all cynological
centres of the Russian Federation.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: Dog of medium to slightly larger
size; substantial with strong and clean built. The length of the body,
measured from the forechest to the buttocks is slightly superior to the
height measured from the withers to ground.


FCI-St. N° 306 / 02.03.2011
Sexual dimorphism is clearly pronounced. Males are bigger than
females and clearly masculine. Muscles are well developed and bone
strong.

### IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS:


Body length exceeds height at the withers as 100 to 103-107%, in
males and as 100 to 104-108 % in females.
Height at withers exceeds height at the croup by 1-2 cm (males) and
it is equal to or exceeds the height at the croup by 1 cm (females).
Length of the head exceeds considerably the width of the head.
Length of the muzzle is equal to, or a little less than half the length of
the head.
Legs height from ground to elbow slightly exceeds half the height at
the withers.

BEHAVIOUR AND TEMPERAMENT: Steady, evenly-tempered.
A vigorous dog with very well developed sense of scent and
detecting game, with an alert, sensitive and pronounced passion for
hunting, is equally keen to hunt feathered as furred game. Selfconfident and alert towards strangers.

HEAD: Lean, wedge shaped, in proportion to the size of the dog. It
is similar in shape to an equilateral triangle when viewed from
above. Cranial part is moderately broad; lesser in females than in
males.

### CRANIAL REGION:


Skull: Elongated, obviously longer than broad; when seen from front
flat or slightly rounded. The bridge of muzzle is parallel to topline of
skull. The sagittal crests and occiput are well pronounced. Occipital
part of the skull is rounded. Superciliary arches slightly developed.
Stop: Slightly pronounced.

### FACIAL REGION:


Nose: Of medium size, black. In white dogs a slightly lighter
(brownish) nose colour is tolerated.


FCI-St. N° 306 / 02.03.2011
Muzzle: Moderately pointed, broadening in the fang area. The length
of the muzzle is half, or slightly shorter, than the length of the head.
Viewed in profile the muzzle is moderately wedge-shaped.
Lips: Tight.
Jaw / Teeth: White, large, strong, well developed, evenly positioned
and un-crowded; complete (42 teeth) dental formula; scissor bite.
Cheeks: Clean in cheekbones.

EYES: Not large, oval shaped, slanting, set fairly deep (more so than
in the other Laika breeds) with intent and intelligent expression. The
eye colour is dark brown or brown in accordance with coat colour.

EARS: Pricked, set on high, V-shaped with pointed tips, mobile. Ear
lobes are slightly developed.

NECK: Muscular, dry and long; length equal to length of head. Oval
in cross-section. The neck is set at approximately 45°-55° to the
horizontal line.

### BODY:


Topline: Firm and solid, slightly slopping from the withers to the
tail-set.
Withers: Well pronounced, especially in males.
Back: Strong, straight, well-muscled, moderately broad.
Loin: Short, moderately broad, well-muscled, with a slight arch.
Croup: Broad, moderately long, slightly sloping.
Chest: Moderately deep, broad (the chest reaches the point of the
elbow), long; oval-shaped in lateral section.
Underline and belly: Tucked up; the underline from the chest to the
abdominal cavity rises slightly.

TAIL: Tight curl; carried over back or hips. When full straightened
can reach the hock joint, or may be 1-2 cm shorter.

### LIMBS



### FOREQUARTERS:

wide apart and parallel. The height of the forelegs from the elbow to
the ground is a little superior to half of the height at the withers.
Shoulder: Long and well laid back.
Upper arm: Long, place obliquely, muscular. Well angulated
between the shoulder blade and the upper arm.
Elbow: Fitting close to the body; points of the elbows are well
developed and placed back, parallel to the body axis.
Forearm: Long, straight, not coarse, muscular, oval in cross-section.
Metacarpus (Pastern): Not long, slightly sloping when viewed from
the side. Dewclaws are not desirable.
Forefeet: Oval, arched with tight toes. Middle toes are a little longer.

General appearance: Muscular, strong, with well defined angulations
of all articulations.
When viewed from the rear legs are straight and parallel.
Thigh: Moderately long, placed obliquely.
Stifle (Knee): Well bent.
Lower thigh: Moderately long, placed obliquely, not shorter than the
upper thigh.
Metatarsus (Rear pastern): Placed almost vertically. Seen from the
side, a perpendicular line, from the buttocks to ground, should fall
close to the front of the rear pastern. Dewclaws are not desirable.
Hind feet: Slightly smaller than forefeet. Oval, arched with tight toes.
Middle toes are slightly longer.

GAIT / MOVEMENT: Free, energetic. Typical movement is short
trot, alternating with gallop.

### COAT


Hair: Outer coat is dense, harsh and straight. Undercoat is well
developed, soft, abundant and woolly. The coat on the head and ears
is short and dense. The coat on shoulders and the neck is longer than
on the body and forms a collar; on the cheekbones it forms sidewhiskers. In males the coat on the withers is longer.
Limbs are covered with short, harsh, dense coat, which is slightly
longer on the back side of the fore limbs. The coat on the back of
rear legs forms trousers without feathering.
There is a protective growth of brush-like hair between the toes. The
tail is profusely covered with straight and harsh hair that is just
slightly longer on the underside but without feathering.

Colour: Grey with reddish-brown, red with reddish-brown, grey, red,
fawn and reddish-brown in all shades. Pure white or parti-colour i.e.
white with patches of any colour mentioned above similar to the
ground body colour.
