### BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY:


This is a Russian breed of hunting dogs from the European forest
areas of Russia. The first record about northern ear-pointed dogs was
published by A. A. Shirinsky-Shikhmatov in the “Album of northern
sledge dogs-laikas” in 1895. The dogs mentioned therein were
named Cheremis and Zyrianskiy Laikas. The breed was limited to
the regions of Komi, Udmurtia, Arkhangelsk, Yaroslavl, Tver,
Moscow and some other areas of Russia.
In 1947 the off-spring of Arkhangelsk, Komi, Karelia, Votiatsk and
other Laikas were united into one breed under the modern name of: –
Russian-European Laika.
The breed standard for Russian-European Laika as a purebred dog
was approved in 1952.
The correct modern type of Russian-European Laika, as a recognized
purebred dog, was not achieved by breeding different Laikas offspring; it is the result of selective breeding over a long period of time

GENERAL APPEARANCE: Medium sized dog; of medium to
strong built.




FCI-St. N° 304 / 02.03.2011
The overall impression is that of a square built dog, the length of the
body (point of shoulders to point of buttocks) being equal to the
height at the withers; however, the length of the body may be slightly
superior to the height at the withers. The muscles are lean and well
developed. Strong bone structure. Sexual dimorphism is clearly
pronounced.

### IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS:


Males square to almost square and females slightly longer.
Index of format (height/length):  males:
100/100-103

females:
100/100-105.
The height at the withers exceeds the height at the croup by 1-2 cm
in males and it is equal to or exceeds the height at the croup by 1 cm
in females.
The length of the muzzle is a little less than half the length of the
head.
The distance from ground to elbow is slightly more than the distance
from withers to elbow.

BEHAVIOUR AND TEMPERAMENT: Steady, evenly-tempered,
with very well developed sense of scent and detection of game.

HEAD: Lean; viewed from above, it is wedge-shaped, triangular and
longer than broad.

### CRANIAL REGION:


Skull: Relatively broad; and occiput is well pronounced.

Stop: Slightly protruding superciliary arches give the impression of a
pronounced stop, but it is never sharply pronounced.

### FACIAL REGION:


Nose: Of medium size; the nose is black in all coat colours.
Muzzle: Lean and pointed. The length of the muzzle is a slightly less
than the length of the skull. The planes of the muzzle (nasal bone)
and the skull are parallel.
Lips: Tight and firmly fitted.


FCI-St. N° 304 / 02.03.2011
Jaws/Teeth: White, large, strong, completely developed and evenly
positioned. Complete (42 teeth) dental formula; scissor bite.

pronounced.

EYES: Not large, oval-shaped, with moderately oblique set eyelids;
not deep set or protruding, with vivid and intelligent expression.
Dark brown or brown eye colour in any colour of coat.

EARS: Pricked, not large, mobile, set on high, V-shaped, pointed.

NECK: Muscular, lean and dry, long-oval in cross-section, its length
is equal to the length of the head. The neck is set at approximately
45° - 50° to the horizontal.

### BODY:


Withers: Well developed, very well pronounced, especially in males.
Back: Straight, strong, muscular, moderately wide.
Loins: Short, wide, well-muscled, slightly arched.
Croup: Broad, moderately long, slightly sloping.
Chest: Broad, deep, oval-shaped cross-section; reaching the elbows.
Underline and belly: Tucked up; the underline from the chest to the
abdominal cavity is well pronounced.

TAIL: Curled or sickle curled; touches the back, the upper thigh or
buttocks. When stretched reach down to the hock joint or be 2-3 cm
shorter.

### LIMBS



### FOREQUARTERS:


General appearance: Legs lean, muscular; viewed from the front
straight, moderately wide and parallel. The height of the forelegs
from the elbow to the ground is slightly superior to half the height at
the withers.
Shoulder: Shoulder blades are long and well laid back.
Upper arm: Long, well placed back, muscular. The angulations
between the shoulder blade and the upper arm is well pronounced.


FCI-St. N° 304 / 02.03.2011
Elbow: Fitting close to the body; elbows are well developed and
placed backwards, parallel to the body axis.
Forearm: Straight, lean, muscular, of oval-cross section, viewed from
the front moderately wide and parallel.
Metacarpus (Pastern): Short, slightly sloping when viewed from the
side. Preferably no first digits (dewclaws). Forefeet: Oval, arched
with tight toes.
Forefeet: Oval, arched with tight toes.

### HINDQUARTERS:


General appearance: Muscular, with well defined angulations of all
articulations.
When viewed from the rear the legs are straight and parallel.
Thigh: Moderately long, placed obliquely.
Stifle (Knee): Well angulated.
Lower thigh: Not shorter than the upper thighs; placed obliquely.
Metatarsus (Rear pastern): Placed almost vertically. Seen from the
side, a perpendicular line, from the buttocks to ground, should fall
close to the front of the rear pastern. The presence of dewclaws is not
desirable.
Hind feet: Oval, arched with tight toes.

GAIT / MOVEMENT: Free movement.

SKIN: Skin is thick and elastic.

### COAT


Hair: Outer coat is harsh and straight. Undercoat is well developed,
thick, soft, abundant and woolly. The coat on the head and ears is
short and dense. The coat on the shoulders and the neck is longer
than on the body and forms a collar; on the cheekbones it forms sidewhiskers. The coat on the withers is also slightly longer, especially in
males.
Limbs are covered with short, harsh, dense coat, which is a little
longer on the back side of limbs. The coat on the rear legs forms
trousers without feathering.
There is a protective growth of hair between the toes.


FCI-St. N° 304 / 02.03.2011
The tail is profusely covered with straight and harsh hair which is a
little bit longer on the underside but without feathering.
Colour: The most typical colours are black with white or white with
black. Solid black as well as solid white also occur.

### SIZE:


Height at the withers: Males 52 - 58 cms. Females 48 - 54 cms.
