### Mountain and Cattle



Dogs.

Section 2.2 Molossoid breeds,



Mountain type.

Without working trial.

BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: Since remote times, this dog
has developed and settled in the Estrela Mountains area, its true
origin being lost in time. Nevertheless, it can be considered one of
the most ancient breeds in the Iberian Peninsula. It can be found
from the foot of the mountains to the summit (approximately 2000
m), mainly in the summer, after the snow has melted, when the green
pastures are much sought after by the herds, because the excessive
heat has dried the grass on the lowlands. The progressive recognition
of its aptitudes has led to its diffusion throughout the world since the
second half of the 20th century.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: Large, mastiff-type molossoid dog.
There are two varieties of coat: long and short. Rustic, substantial,
with brisk gait and an impressive attitude.




FCI-St. N° 173 / 30.03.2009

The breed has a lively, calm, and expressive look; it is well
proportioned; well made with harmonious appearance, which is
traditionally how the breed has been recognised since a long time.

### IMPORTANT



### PROPORTIONS:


Moderately
long
(sublongilinear), tending to mediolinear. The depth of the chest is less
than half the height at withers. The muzzle and skull should be
approximately the same length; if not, the skull should be slightly
longer.

BEHAVIOUR/TEMPERAMENT: Inseparable companion of the
shepherd and faithful flock guardian, bravely protecting it against
predators and thieves. Wonderful farm and house guard, distrustful
towards strangers and typically docile to its master.

HEAD: Strong, voluminous, and long and slightly convex seen in
profile. Well inserted and in good proportion to the body, with the
skull in proportion to the foreface; all parts in perfect harmony.
Smooth skin on the skull and cheeks.

### CRANIAL REGION:


Skull: Well developed, rounded, with slightly divergent longitudinal
superior cranium-facial axes, convex profile, slightly developed
superciliary arches with slightly apparent frontal furrow, occipital
protuberance not prominent.
Stop: Only slightly marked and at approximately equal distance to
the tip of the nose and the occipital protuberance.

### FACIAL REGION:


Nose: Straight and in line with nosebridge; well opened nostrils;
large and black.
Muzzle: Long, tapering to the tip, without being pointed; tends to be
straight but very slightly convex at the tip.
Lips: Well developed but not thick, well overlapping, not pendulous;
mucous membrane of mouth, palate and edges of lips with intense
black pigmentation.


FCI-St. N° 173 / 30.03.2009
Jaws/Teeth: Clean cut mouth with well-developed jaws; full
dentition with strong, white, well implanted and close-fitting teeth,
preferably with scissors bite, pincer bite acceptable.

EYES: Medium sized, tending to small, oval shaped, level set, equal
in size and well open, with a keen and calm expression; preferably
dark amber in colour. Close fitting lids with black rims. Eyebrows
slightly apparent.

EARS: Set on at medium height; hanging, carried falling backwards
and laterally against the side of the head, with inner edge visible (so
called rose-ear); thin, triangular, rounded at the tip; small in
comparison to the body.

NECK: Short, straight, and thick; well set and well connected into
the shoulders; with a slight dewlap, not exaggerated.

### BODY:


Topline: Straight. Almost level.
Back: Preferably short, well muscled.
Loin: Short; broad; well-muscled; well connected to the croup.
Croup: Slightly sloping; short, broad, and muscled. Height at croup
should be equal or slightly superior to the height at the withers.
Chest: Broad; deep; well sprung without being cylindrical; well let
down to the elbow or slightly below it.
Underline and belly: The underline should rise gradually but
smoothly from sternum to the groin; belly not too wide, in
proportion to the animal’s substance and harmoniously connected to
the body.

TAIL: Set on at medium height; long; thick; carried below the
horizontal, scimitar-shaped, with a hook at the end.
At rest it hangs naturally between the thighs, reaching at least the
hock; when excited and in motion, the tail rises above the horizontal,
curving upward and forward, sideways, and downward, without
being carried over the croup. It should be well furnished with hair
and feathered in the long-haired variety.
