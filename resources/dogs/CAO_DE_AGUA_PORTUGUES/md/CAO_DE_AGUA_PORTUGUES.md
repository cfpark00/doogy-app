& J. Mulholland and Renée Sporre-Willes. Official language (EN).

ORIGIN: Portugal.

### DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THE OFFICIAL VALID



### STANDARD: 04.11.2008.



UTILIZATION: Assistance with fishing and retrieving as well as
companion dog.

FCI- CLASSIFICATION:  Group  8 Retrievers, Flushing Dogs,


Water Dogs.

Section 3 Water dogs.

Without working trial.

BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: In ancient times, the
Portuguese Water Dog could be found throughout the entire
Portuguese coast.  Thereafter, due to continuous changes in fishing


methods, the breed was located mainly in the Algarve region which
is now considered as its original birthplace.  Its presence on the
Portuguese coast is probably very remote and thus the Portuguese
Water Dog should be considered as an autochthonous Portuguese
breed.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: A dog of medium proportions,
bracoïd tending to rectilinear to slight convex.  Harmonious in shape,
balanced, strong and well muscled.  Considerable development of the
muscles due to constant swimming.

IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS: Of almost square shape, with the
length of body approximately equal to height at the withers.




FCI-St. N° 37 / 30.03.2009
The ratio of the height at the withers to the depth of the chest is 2:1;
the ratio of length of skull to muzzle is 4:3.

BEHAVIOUR/TEMPERAMENT: Exceptionally intelligent, it
understands and obeys easily and happily any order given by its
owner.  An animal with impetuous disposition, wilful, courageous,
sober and resistant to fatigue. It has a severe, penetrating and
attentive expression, as well as remarkable visual and scent faculties.
An excellent and resistant swimmer and diver, it is the inseparable
companion of the fisherman for whom it performs a multitude of
tasks, both in fishing and in guarding and protecting its boat and
property. While fishing, it will willingly jump to sea to retrieve
escaped fish, diving if necessary and likewise if a net breaks or a
cable becomes loose.   It is also used as a liaison between boats and
shore or vice-versa, even at great distances.

HEAD: Well proportioned, strong and broad. Parallel longitudinal
axes of the skull and muzzle.

### CRANIAL REGION:


Skull: Seen in profile it is slightly longer than the muzzle (4:3).  Its
curvature is more accentuated at the back and the occipital
protuberance is pronounced.  Seen from the front the parietal bones
are rounded with a slight depression in the middle; the front is
slightly hollow, the frontal furrow extends to two thirds of the
parietal bones and the superciliary arches are prominent.
Stop: Well defined and slightly behind the inner corners of the eyes.

### FACIAL REGION:


Nose: Wide, with well open and pigmented nostrils. Black in black,
white and pied animals.  In brown specimens the nose is the same
colour as the coat, but never marbled.
Muzzle: Straight, broader at the base than at the extremity.




FCI-St. N° 37 / 30.03.2009
Lips: Thick, especially in front. Commissure not prominent. Mucous
membranes (palate, under the tongue and gums) deeply pigmented in
black, deep brown in brown dogs.
Jaws/Teeth: Strong, healthy teeth, not visible when mouth is closed.
Strong and well developed canines. Scissor bite or pincer bite.

EYES: Medium sized; noticeable and rounded in shape; set well
apart and slightly slanted.  The iris is black or brown and the lids are
thin and black edged, brown in brown dogs.  Unapparent
conjunctive.

EARS: Set above the eye line, held against the head, slightly raised
from the rear and heart-shaped.  Thin in texture, their extremity
never reaches below the throat.

Underline & belly: Gracefully shaped and reduced in volume.

TAIL: Natural, of medium set-on, thick at its base, tapering towards
the end.  Should not reach below the hock.  When attentive curls in a
ring, not reaching beyond the middle of the loin. It is a useful aid for
swimming and diving.

GAIT/MOVEMENT: Easy movement with short steps at walk;
light cadenced trot and energetic gallop.

SKIN: Thick, supple; not very tight; internal and external mucous
membranes preferably pigmented.

### COAT


Hair: The whole body is abundantly covered with strong hair, with
no undercoat.
There are two varieties: one long and wavy and the other shorter and
curly. The first is slightly shiny and woolly; the latter is dense,
lustreless and forms compact cylindrical curls.  Except for the
underarms and groin the coat is even all over the skin. On the head it
forms a topknot of wavy hair in the long and wavy variety and of
curly hair in the curly variety.  The hair in the ears is longer in the
long and wavy variety.

Colour: The coat is black or brown of various shades, or solid white.
In black or brown coats, white is accepted in the following locations:
muzzle, topknot, neck, forechest, belly, tip of tail and lower
extremities of the limbs, below the elbows and hocks.  The white
coat must not be albino, consequently the nose, eyelids and inside of
the mouth should be pigmented in black, and brown in brown dogs.
In this breed partial clipping of the coat, when it is too long, is
typical.  The hindquarters, the muzzle and part of the tail are clipped,
leaving a plume of full-length hair at the tip of the tail.
