UTILIZATION: Pack Hound for big game.

FCI-CLASSIFICATION: Group 6
Scenthounds and related

breeds.

Section 1.1 Large sized Hounds.

With working trial.

BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: The French White and
Black Hound evolved from the Saintonge Hound whose origins are
uncertain; while it has no connection with the Saint Hubert, there is
probably a distant ancestry with the famous white “Greffier” dogs of
the XVIth century. Appearing in the second half of the XIXth
century, the present type was influenced by later cross-breeding with
the Poitevin and the Gascon-saintongeois. It obtained its standard in


## 1957. At present, the breed counts approximately 2000 subjects,


representing 300/400 births per year.
The 2007 text was drafted by Mr. Pierre Astié, President of the
“Club du chien d’ordre”, and his committee, in collaboration with
Mr. Raymond Triquet.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: Large pack hound, distinguished and
of balanced build.

IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS: The muzzle is long compared to
the skull. The length of the body, from the point of the shoulder to
the point of buttock, is equal to the height at the withers.

### BEHAVIOUR/TEMPERAMENT:


These
dogs
are
very
appreciated by many deer hunts for the following qualities: fine
noses, diligence, seriousness and throat. It is a friendly dog, close to
humans and easy to manage in the kennels.

HEAD: Rather long, in harmony with the whole body without ever
being heavy or coarse, but expressive and well carried.

### CRANIAL REGION:


Skull: Slightly domed, rather narrow without exaggeration.
Occipital protuberance apparent without excess, but sufficient to
avoid the skull appearing too flat. The superciliary arches can be
slightly prominent.
Stop: Slightly pronounced.

### FACIAL REGION:


Nose: Black. Nostrils well open.
Muzzle: Rather long compared to the skull; the nose bridge may be
slightly arched.
Lips: The flews are slightly square; the upper lip just overlaps the
lower lip.

EYES: Dark, intelligent and trusting expression.

EARS: Set at eye level, slightly curled. When pulled forward, they
should reach, at least, the base of the nose leather.

NECK: Quite long and strong, with sometimes a slight trace of
dewlap.

### BODY:


Back: Rather long but well sustained.
Loin: Muscled and attached.
Croup: Slightly sloping.
Chest: More deep than broad and reaching the point of the elbow.
Ribs long and more flat than round.
Underline & Belly: Slightly tucked up.



FCI-St. N° 220 / 12.01.2009
TAIL: Quite thick at its root; carried relatively high.

### LIMBS



### FOREQUARTERS:

Shoulder: Long, lean and oblique.
Elbow: Close to the body.
Forearm: Upright.
Metacarpus(pastern): Very slightly sloping, seen from the side.
Forefeet: Rather long, lean and resistant.

### HINDQUARTERS:

extended gallop.

SKIN: White under white hair, black under black hair with
sometimes sub-cutaneous patches on the belly and inner thighs of
blue or pale blue colour.

### COAT


Hair: Short, quite strong and dense.

Colour: Obligatory white and black, with a black mantle or with
more or less widely spread black markings and possible black or
bluish speckling, or even tan freckles but the latter only permitted on
the limbs. A pale tan dot above each eye as well as a pale tan on the
cheeks, below the eyes, below the ears and at the base of the tail.
The “roebuck mark” is quite frequent on the thigh.

Males:
65 to 72 cm.
