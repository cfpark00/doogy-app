FCI-St. N° 290 / 6.10.2023

level; they are slightly rounded in their medium part; they come
down flat against the skull to turn slightly in their lower part in a
slight oval.

in profile in its upper part.

### BODY:


Back: Short, well sustained and muscled.
Loin: Strong and muscled; can be slightly arched.
Chest: Well set down, but ribs never too flat, which could reduce the
thoracic cage too much.  Sternum well extended to the rear.  The
false ribs, without being cylindrical, must nevertheless be long and
sufficiently well sprung so as to provide an ample thoracic cage.
Underline and belly: Never very tucked up, rather filled out.

FCI-St. N° 290 / 6.10.2023

Colour: Tri-colour (fawn with black blanket, and white); not too
much importance should be given to the blanket, with markings more
or less bright tan, or pale, or with black overlay.  Because there exist
grey Harrier, the grey tri-colours or the white-greys would not be
either disqualified or penalised only because of their colour.

### SIZE:


Height at withers: From 45 cm to 50 cm.

FAULTS: Any departure from the foregoing points should be
considered a fault and the seriousness with which the fault should be
regarded should be in exact proportion to its degree and its effect
upon the health and welfare of the dog.
