UTILIZATION: Versatile working gundog with all the aptitudes

Group  7      Pointing Dogs.

Section 1.1 Continental Pointing



Dogs.
With Working Trial.

BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: The Pudelpointer is a rough
coated pointing dog that originates genetically from two breeds, the
Poodle and the Pointer, and that has come into being completely
isolated from other pointing breeds. Although the Poodle has only
been used for creating the foundation breeding stock its
characteristics have been preserved till today. In combination with
the extraordinary abilities of the Pointer in the fields, its fine scent
and its far seeking nose, its fast and wide ranging search and its taut
pointing, a versatile, genetically sound and healthy working gundog
has emerged, corresponding to the requirements for hunting. The
country of origin attaches special significance to the state of health of
the Pudelpointer with special emphasis on the prevention of hip
dysplasia (HD) and epilepsy in the breed.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: Ideally the conformation displays a
Pointer of heavy type with not too long rough coat of dead leaf or
black colour protecting the whole body.
