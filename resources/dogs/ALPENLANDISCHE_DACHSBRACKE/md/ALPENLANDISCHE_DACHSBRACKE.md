BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: Already in ancient times, a
hunting/shooting dog was used which bore a remarkable resemblance
in appearance to the Alpine Dachsbracke.  Crown Prince Rudolf of
Habsburg in 1881 and 1885 made his gamekeepers from Mursteg
and Ischl include Alpine Dachsbracken on his hunting trips to
Turkey and to Egypt.  In 1932 the “Alpine- Erzgebirgs-
Dachsbracke” was recognized by the top canine organisations in
Austria as the third Scenthound breed.  In 1975 the name was altered
to “Alpenländische Dachsbracke” and the F.C.I. declared Austria as
the country of origin.  In 1991 the Alpenländische Dachsbracke was
included in Section 2 of Scenthounds in the FCI nomenclature.
