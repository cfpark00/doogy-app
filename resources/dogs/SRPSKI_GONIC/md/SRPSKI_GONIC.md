Section 1.2  Medium sized
scenhounds
With working trial.

BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: The breed belongs to the
group of scent hounds which have spread throughout the Balkan
territory. It is thought that the scent hounds from Asia Minor played
an important part in its genesis. The first description of this breed
under the name of Balkan scent hound dates from 1005; for this we
are endebted to Frank Laska who described this breed together with
other scent hounds. The first standard was drawn up in 1924 , but it
was only at its session in Bled on May 14th 1940 that the F.C.I.
adopted the standards already announced in Stockholm in 1939 and
among these was included that of the Balkan scent hound. Because
the breed was most widespread in Serbia, it was the Yugoslav
Cynological Association which controlled breeding and put in place
the first registrations in the official stud book. On November 12th
1996,during its meeting in Copenhagen, the General Committee of
the F .C.I. discussed the motion put forward by the annual general
meeting of the Yugoslav Cynological Association, and accepted that
the name Balkan scent hound be replaced by Serbian hound.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: Dog of medium size with a robust
constitution. Full of character, it is lively and energetic.
