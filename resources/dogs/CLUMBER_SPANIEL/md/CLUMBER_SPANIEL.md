BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: Clumber Spaniels are said to
have come in the first place from France over two hundred years
ago, the Clumber was brought to Great Britain by the Duke of
Newcastle, and bred at his family home of Clumber Park in
Nottinghamshire.
It is a very heavy dog, and his pace of working is more leisurely than
that of other Spaniels. That has been allowed to become ever heavier
since around the 1950s, and though the top weight for dogs now
stands at 34 kgs, it would appear that some are in excess of even this
figure. However, lovers of the breed should make certain that his
great size does not encourage any weakness in his hindquarters.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: Balanced, well boned, active with a
thoughtful expression, overall appearance denoting strength. The
Clumber should be firm, fit and capable of a day’s work in the
field.

BEHAVIOUR AND TEMPERAMENT: Stoical, great-hearted,
highly intelligent with a determined attitude enhancing his natural
ability. A silent worker with an excellent nose. Steady, reliable, kind
and dignified; more aloof than other Spaniels, showing no tendency
towards aggression.

HEAD:  Large, square, medium length. No exaggeration in head
and skull.
