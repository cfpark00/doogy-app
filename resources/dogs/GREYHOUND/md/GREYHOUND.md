BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: The experts, although not
unanimous, consider that the Greyhound could have had its origins in
the Middle East. Drawings of Greyhound-type dogs have been found
on walls in Ancient Egyptian tombs, dating as far back as 4000 BC.
Though dogs of the type spread through Europe over the years, it
was in Britain that they were developed to a standard. The prototype
of the so-called sighthounds, or gazehounds, the Greyhound is well
known to many people. The coursing hound, which hunts the live
hare, is what the racing Greyhound were developed from, only the
cheetah tops the Greyhound for speed. One racing Greyhound was
clocked at over 45 mph.

generous proportions, muscular power and symmetrical formation,
with long head and neck, clean well laid shoulders, deep chest,

degree its distinctive type and quality.
