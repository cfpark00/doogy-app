ORIGIN: Croatia.

### DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THE OFFICIAL VALID



### STANDARD: 03.11.2014.



UTILIZATION:  A hound with lots of stamina particularly fitted
for hare, fox and boar hunting but can also be used as a tracking
leash hound.

FCI-CLASSIFICATION: Group 6
Scenthounds and related



breeds.
Section 1.2 Medium sized scenthounds
With working trial.

BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: The breed descends from the
“East Adriatic white hound with markings”. The hair is wire-haired
due to the climate, where the breed was bred. These are mountain
areas at the east Adriatic coast, where temperatures are low.
The earliest description of the wire-haired Istrian Hound can be
found in the manuscript of the Dakovoe Bishop Petar Bakic from the
year 1719, where it says that the breeding of this breed was already
known before the 14th century. The earliest picture document of this
breed can be found in the cathedral of the Evangelist Markus in
Makarska. The FCI published the first standard for the Istrian WireHaired Hound on the 6th of April 1955.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: A dog of rustic appearance and strong
hound-like body, of medium size with characteristic longer coarse
hair of snow-white colour with orange coloured markings on the
head and on the body. Due to the wire-haired coat this breed appears
robust. The difference between male and female has to be distinctive.

SKIN: Elastic, of medium thickness, well fitting to the body, without

a form of greyish-black (sometimes brownish) mottles, which is
visible through the white coat. This is permitted.

### COAT:

dull, about 5–8 cms long. It should not lay flat on the body. The hair
must not be curly or form locks. On the muzzle it forms moustaches
and a beard and above the eyes well pronounced eyebrows, where it

straighter. Under the topcoat is a shorter more dense undercoat,
which lies close to the body and is more evident during the
wintertime.

on the skull and on the foreface but the head must not be completely
orange coloured. A symmetrical spread of the markings on the head
is desirable. The markings on the body can be anywhere, mostly on
the back, on the ribcage and around the tail set. Markings have the
shape of spots, which have to be clearly separated. They must not get
uneven or paler towards the edge of the markings. Small spots, if
visible through white basic colour, can usually be found on ears.
