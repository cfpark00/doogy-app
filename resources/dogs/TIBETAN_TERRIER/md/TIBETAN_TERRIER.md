BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: In spite of the name, the
Tibetan Terrier is not a terrier but a herding dog, doubling as a guard
for traders as they journeyed to and from China. It succeeded in his
job not so much by size but through the awe in which he was held.
This is believed to be the original Holy Dog of Tibet. It is said to be
even livelier than the other Tibetan breeds in Group 9, his energy and
enthusiasm balancing his ability as a miniature guard dog along the
lines of a small Old English Sheepdog.

generally square outline.

root of tail equal to height at withers.
