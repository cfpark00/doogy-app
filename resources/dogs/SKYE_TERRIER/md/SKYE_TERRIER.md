BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: One of the oldest Scottish
breeds; The Skye was once known as the Terrier of the Western
Isles, evolving into what we now call the Skye Terrier, with a mix of
breeds behind him, including Cairn Terrier prototypes. One of the
most famed of the breed was Greyfriars Bobby who, in Edinburgh,
around 1858 took up a vigil at his master’s grave in Greyfriars
Churchyard until he too died. Greyfriars Bobby was buried in unconsecrated ground in the churchyard and his devotion is
commemorated by a memorial plaque in the street and by a tablet on
his grave. Although the majority of Skye Terriers are prick-eared,
there is also a variety known as ‘drop-eared’, and then the ears hang
flat against the skull.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: Long; twice as long as high, with
coat of good length, Moves with seemingly effortless gait. Strong in
quarters, body and jaw.

IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS: Body long, low, twice as long as
high.

BEHAVIOUR / TEMPERAMENT: Elegant and dignified. A ‘oneman’ dog, distrustful of strangers, never vicious.
