### ZWERGSCHNAUZER


(Miniature Schnauzer)




FCI-St. N° 183 / 18.04.2007

TRANSLATION:  Mrs C. Seidler. Official language (DE).

COUNTRY OF ORIGIN:  Germany.

### DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THE OFFICIAL VALID



### STANDARD: 06.03.07.



UTILISATION: House and Companion Dog

FCI-CLASSIFICATION: Group 2
Pinscher and Schnauzer-
Molossoid breeds - Swiss
Mountain and Cattle Dogs.


Section 1   Pinscher and Schnauzer
type.



Without working trial.

BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: Around the turn of the
century a dwarf Schnauzer from the Frankfurt/Main area went on his
way, then still described as a rough haired Zwergpinscher (Miniature
Pinscher). Due to the different shapes, sizes and types and the
muddle of harsh, soft and silky coat textures, it was no easy task to
evolve a small dog with the appearance and the characteristic
qualities of his bigger brother, the Schnauzer.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: Small, strong, stocky rather than slim,
rough coated, elegant. A reduced image of the Schnauzer without the
drawback of a dwarfed appearance.

### IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS:


•
Square build in which the height at the withers is nearly equal to
the body length.
•
The length of the head (measured from the tip of the nose to the
occiput) corresponds to half the length of the topline (measured
from the withers to the set on of the tail).



FCI-St. N° 183 / 18.04.2007
BEHAVIOUR/TEMPERAMENT: His nature is similar to that of
the Schnauzer and is determined by the temperament and the
behaviour of a small dog. Intelligence, fearlessness, endurance, and
alertness make the Miniature Schnauzer an agreeable house dog as
well as a watch and companion dog which can be kept even in a
small apartment without problems.

### HEAD



### CRANIAL REGION


Skull: Strong, long without markedly protruding occiput. The head
should be in keeping with the dog’s force. The forehead is flat,
without wrinkles and parallel to the bridge of nose.
Stop: Appears well defined due to the brows

### FACIAL REGION



Nose:  Well developed nose leather, always black.
Muzzle: Ending in a blunt wedge. Bridge of nose straight.
Lips: Black, smoot and tight-fitting to the jaws. Corners of lips
closed.
Jaws/Teeth: Strong upper and lower jaw.  The complete scissor bite
(42 pure white teeth according to the dentition formula), is strongly
developed and firmly closing. The chewing muscles are strongly
developed but the cheeks must not interfere with the rectangular
shape of the head (with the beard).

EYES: Medium sized, oval, facing forward, dark with lively
expression. Eyelids close fitting.

EARS: Drop ears, set high, V-shaped with inner edges lying close to
the cheeks, evenly carried, turned forward towards temples.  Folds
parallel, should not be above the top of the skull.

NECK:  The strong, muscular neck is nobly arched, blending
smoothly into the withers.
Strongly set on, slim, nobly curved, corresponding to the dog’s force.
Throat skin  tight-fitting without folds.



FCI-St. N° 183 / 18.04.2007


### BODY


Topline: Slightly sloping from withers towards rear.
Withers: Forming the highest point in topline.
Back: Strong, short, and taut.
Loins: Short, strong, and deep. The distance from the last rib to the
hip is short to make the dog appear compact.
Croup: Slightly rounded and imperceptibly blending into tail set on.
Chest: Moderately broad, oval in diameter, reaching to the elbows.
The forechest is distinctly marked by the point of the sternum.
Underline and belly: Flanks not too tucked up, forming a well curved
line with the underside of the ribcage.

TAIL: Natural; a sabre or sickle carriage is sought after.

### LIMBS



### FOREQUARTERS:


General appearance: Seen from the front, the front legs are strong,
straight and not close together. Seen from the side, the forearms are
straight.
Shoulders: The shoulder blade lies close against the rib cage and is
well muscled on both sides of the shoulder bone, protruding over the
points of the thoracic vertebrae. As sloping as possible and well laid
back, forming an angle of appr. 50° to the horizontal.
Upper arm: Lying close to the body, strong and well-muscled,
forming an angle of 95° to 105° to the shoulder blade.
Elbows: Close fitting, turning neither in nor out.
Forearm: Viewed from all sides, completely straight, strongly
developed and well-muscled.
Carpal joint: Strong, firm, barely standing out against the structure of
the forearm.
Pastern: Seen from the front, vertical. Seen from the side slightly
sloping towards the ground, strong and slightly springy.
Forefeet: Short and round. Toes well-knit and arched (cat foot) with
short dark nails and resistant pads.




FCI-St. N° 183 / 18.04.2007


### HINDQUARTERS:


General appearance: Standing obliquely when seen from the side,
standing parallel but not close together when seen from the rear.
Upper thigh: Moderately long, broad and strongly muscled.
Stifle: Turning neither in nor out.
Lower thigh: Long, strong and sinewy, running into a strong hock.
Hock: Very well angulated, strong, firm, turning neither in nor out.
Metatarsus: Short, vertical to the ground.
Hind feet: Toes short, arched and well-knit. Nails short and black.

GAIT/MOVEMENT: Flexible, elegant, agile, free and ground
covering. The forelegs swinging as far forward as possible, the hind
legs, ground covering and springy, provide the necessary drive. The
front leg of one side and the hind leg of the other side move forward
at the same time. The back, the ligaments and the joints are firm.

SKIN: Tight fitting over the whole body.

### COAT



Hair: The coat should be wiry, harsh, and dense. It consists of a
dense undercoat and a not too short top coat, lying close to the body.
The top coat is rough and sufficiently long to allow the checking of
its texture; it is neither bristly nor wavy. The hair on the limbs tends
to be less harsh. Coat short on forehead and ears. Typical
characteristics are the not too soft beard on the muzzle and the bushy
eyebrows which slightly shade the eyes.

Colour:
•
Pure black with black undercoat.
•
Pepper and Salt.
•
Black/Silver.
•
Pure white with white undercoat.

When breeding Pepper and Salt, the aim is a medium shading with
evenly distributed, well pigmented, pepper colouring and grey
undercoat.


FCI-St. N° 183 / 18.04.2007
The shades from dark iron grey to silver grey are all permitted. In all
colour variations there must be a dark mask, which should adapt
harmoniously to the respective colour.  Distinct light markings on
head, chest and limbs are undesirable.
For the Black/Silver colour, the aim in breeding is a black top coat
with black undercoat, white markings over the eyes, on the cheeks, at
the beard, at the throat, in two divided triangles at the front of the
chest, on the front pasterns, on the feet, on the inside of the hind legs
and around the anus. The forehead, the neck and the outer sides of
the ears should be black like the top coat.

### SIZE AND WEIGHT:


Height at withers:
Dogs and bitches between 30 and 35 cm.

Weight:
Dogs and bitches approximately 4 to 8 kg.

FAULTS: Any departure from the foregoing points should be
considered a fault and the seriousness with which the fault should be
regarded should be in exact proportion to its degree and its effect
upon the health and welfare of the dog.
