UTILIZATION: Racing dog, hunting dog, companion.

FCI-CLASSIFICATION: Group 10
Sighthounds.

Section 2
Rough-haired Sighthounds.

Without working trial.

BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: The Deerhound, known at
one time as the Scottish Deerhound, has mystery surrounding his
origins, but there are grounds for thinking the Deerhound may
have been introduced to Scotland by Phoenician traders.
Certainly there were running hounds there when the Romans
arrived. The breed has hunted the red deer for a thousand years,
and although today more accustomed to the show ring, he has
remained similar in type over the centuries.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: Resembles a rough-coated greyhound
of larger size and bone.

BEHAVIOUR / TEMPERAMENT: The build suggests the unique
combination of speed, power and endurance necessary to pull down a
stag, but general bearing is one of gentle dignity. Gentle and friendly.
Obedient and easy to train because eager to please.  Docile and good
tempered, never suspicious, aggressive or nervous. Carries himself
with quiet dignity.

HEAD: Long.

### CRANIAL REGION:


Skull: Flat rather than round, with very slight rise over eyes.
Broadest at ears, tapering slightly to eyes. Skull coated with
moderately long hair, softer than rest of coat.
Stop: No stop.


FCI-St. N° 164 / 05.12.2012

### FACIAL REGION:


Nose: Slightly aquiline and black.
Muzzle: Tapering more decidedly to nose. In lighter coloured dogs
black muzzle preferred.
Lips: Level. Good moustache of rather silky hair and some beard.
Jaws / Teeth: Jaws strong, with a perfect, regular and complete
scissor bite, i.e. upper teeth closely overlapping lower teeth and set
square to the jaws.

EYES: Dark.  Generally dark brown or hazel.  Light eyes
undesirable.  Moderately full with a soft look in repose, but keen,
far-away look when dog is roused.  Rims black.

EARS: Set on high and in repose folded back.  In excitement raised
above head without losing the fold and in some cases semi-erect.  A
big thick ear hanging flat to the head or a prick ear most undesirable.
Ear soft, glossy and like a mouse’s coat to the touch; the smaller the
better, no long coat or fringe. Ears black or dark coloured.

NECK: Very strong with good reach sometimes disguised by mane.
Nape of neck very prominent where head is set on, no throatiness.

BODY: Body and general formation that of a greyhound of larger size and
bone.
Back: Flat topline undesirable.
Loin: Well arched and drooping to tail.
Croup: Drooping, broad and powerful. Hipbones set wide apart.
Chest: Deep rather than broad, not too narrow and flat-sided.

TAIL: Long, thick at root, tapering and reaching almost to ground.
When standing dropped perfectly straight down or curved.  Curved
when moving, never lifted above line of back.  Well covered with
hair; on upper side thick and wiry, on under side longer, and towards
end a slight fringe is not objectionable.  A curl or ring tail
undesirable.

### LIMBS



### FOREQUARTERS:


General appearance: Forelegs straight, broad and flat.
Shoulder: Well laid, not too far apart.  Loaded and straight shoulders
undesirable.
Elbow: Good breadth desirable.
Forearm: Good breadth desirable.
Forefeet: Compact and well knuckled.  Nails strong.

### HINDQUARTERS:


General appearance: With great length from hip to hock.  Bone broad
and flat.
Stifle (Knee): Well bent.
Hind feet: Compact and well knuckled.  Nails strong.

GAIT / MOVEMENT: Easy, active and true, with a long stride.

### COAT:


Hair: Shaggy, but not over-coated.  Woolly coat unacceptable.  The
correct coat is thick, close-lying, ragged; harsh or crisp to the touch.
Hair on body, neck and quarters harsh and wiry about 8 cms to 10
cms long; that on head, breast and belly much softer.  A slight hairy
fringe on inside of fore- and hindlegs.

Colour: Dark blue-grey, darker and lighter greys or brindles and
yellows, sandy-red or red fawns with black points.  A white chest,
white toes and a slight white tip to stern are permissible but the less
white the better, since it is a self-coloured dog.  A white blaze on
head or white collar unacceptable.

### SIZE AND WEIGHT:


Males:  minimum desirable height at the withers  76 cms.
Weight about 45.5 kgs.
Females: minimum desirable height at the withers  71 cms.


FCI-St. N° 164 / 05.12.2012
Weight about 36.5 kgs.


### FAULTS:


Any departure from the foregoing points should be considered a fault and
the seriousness with which the fault should be regarded should be in exact
proportion to its degree and its effect upon the health and welfare of the
dog and on its ability to perform its traditional work.

### DISQUALIFYING FAULTS


• Aggressive or overly shy dogs.
• Any dog clearly showing physical or behavioural abnormalities.

### N.B.:


• Male animals should have two apparently normal testicles fully

descended into the scrotum.
• Only functionally and clinically healthy dogs, with breed typical

conformation should be used for breeding.
