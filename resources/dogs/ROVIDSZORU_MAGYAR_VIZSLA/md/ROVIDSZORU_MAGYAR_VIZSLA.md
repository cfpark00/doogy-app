ORIGIN: Hungary.

### DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THE OFFICIAL VALID



### STANDARD:  06.04.2000.



UTILISATION: A versatile gun dog that must be able to work in
the field, forest and water, having the following typical qualities: an
excellent nose, firmness on the point, excellent retrieves and
determination to remain on the scent even when swimming, which he
manifestly enjoys. He copes with difficult terrain as well as extreme
weather conditions.  As he is intended to be an efficient hunting dog,
gun and game shyness, unwillingness to point and retrieve, as well as
a dislike of water are undesirable. Because of his easy going nature
and his adaptability, he can easily be kept as a companion dog in the
house.

FCI-CLASSIFICATION:  Group

Dogs.

Trial)

BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: The ancestors of the
Hungarian Vizsla came into the Carpathian Basin with the nomadic
Hungarian tribes. Written descriptions and graphic illustrations are
found in documents of the 14th century already. From the 18th
century, his importance as a hunting dog has been increasing
steadily.
As early as the end of the 19th century, competitions for pointing
dogs were organised in Hungary, in which Hungarian Vizslas
(among others) participated with great success.


FCI-St. N°57  / 13.09.2000
In those days, other Gundog breeds most likely played an important
part in the development of the breed.

The specific modern breeding started in 1920, as a result of which,
the Short-Haired Hungarian Vizsla received recognition by the FCI
in 1936.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: Medium sized, elegant gun dog of
noble appearance with short russet gold coat. His rather light, dry,
lean structure embodies the harmony of beauty and strength.

### IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS:


•
The body length slightly exceeds the height at the withers.
•
The depth of the brisket is slightly less than half the height at the
withers.
•
The muzzle is slightly shorter than half the length of the head.

### BEHAVIOUR/TEMPERAMENT:


Lively,
friendly,
evenly
tempered, to be trained easily. His outstanding willingness to keep
contact with his master while working is one of his essential
qualities. He cannot bear rough treatment and must be neither
aggressive nor shy.

HEAD: Dry, noble, well proportioned.

### CRANIAL REGION:


Skull: Moderately wide, slightly domed. A slightly pronounced
groove runs from the moderately developed occiput towards the stop.
The superciliary ridges are moderately developed.
Stop: Moderate.

### FACIAL REGION:


Nose: Well developed and broad with nostrils as wide as possible.
The colour of the nose harmonises in a dark shading with the coat
colour.
Muzzle: Blunt, not pointed; with strong jaws, strongly muscled. The
bridge of the nose is straight,


FCI-St. N°57  / 13.09.2000
Lips: Tightly fitting, no pendulous flews.

Jaws/Teeth: Powerful jaws with a perfect, regular and complete
scissor bite, the upper teeth closely overlapping the lower teeth and
set square to the jaws; with 42 healthy teeth according to the
dentition formula.
Cheeks: Strong, well muscled.

EYES: Slightly oval, of medium size. Well fitting eyelids. Intelligent
and lively expression. The brown eye harmonising with the coat
colour, as dark as possible preferred.

EARS: Leathers set on at medium height, a little backwards. Fine
leathers hanging closely to the cheeks, ending in a rounded V shape.
The length is about three quarters of the length of the head.

NECK: Of medium length, harmonising with the overall appearance.
The nape very muscular and slightly arched. Tightly fitting skin at
the throat.

### BODY:


Withers: Pronounced and muscular.
Back: Solid, strong, well muscled, taut and straight. The vertebral
spines should be hidden by the muscles.
Loin: Short, broad, tight, muscular, straight or slightly arched. The
portion from back to loin is well coupled.
Croup: Broad and of sufficient length, not cut off short. Sloping
slightly to the tail. Well muscled.
Chest: Deep and broad with well developed, well muscled,
moderately arched forechest; sternum extending as far back as
possible. The sternum and the elbow should be at the same level.
Ribs moderately arched. Last ribs carried well back.
Underline: Elegant, tight, arching line towards the rear, slightly
tucked up.




FCI-St. N°57  / 13.09.2000
TAIL: Set on slightly low, strong at the base, then tapering. In
countries where tail docking is not prohibited by law, the tail may be
shortened by one quarter to avoid hunting hazards.  If tail docking is
prohibited, the tail reaches down to the hock joint and carried straight
or slightly sabre like.
On the move, it is raised up to the horizontal.  It is well covered by
dense coat.

### LIMBS



### FOREQUARTERS:


General appearance: Viewed from the front, straight and parallel.
Viewed from the side, legs are vertical and placed well under the
body. Good bones, strongly muscled.
Shoulders: Long, sloping and flat, well attached shoulder blade.
Flexible. Strong, dry musculature. Well angulated between shoulder
blade and upper arm.
Upper arm: As long as possible. Well muscled.
Elbows: Fitting close to the body, however not tied in, turning
neither in nor out. Well angulated between upper arm and forearm.
Forearm: Long, straight, sufficiently muscled. Bone strong, but not
coarse.
Pastern joint: Strong, tight.
Pastern: Short, only very slightly sloping.
Forefeet: Slightly oval, with well knit, sufficiently arched, strong
toes. Strong brown nails. Tough, resistant, slate grey pads. The feet
are parallel when standing or moving.

### HINDQUARTERS:


General appearance: Viewed from behind, straight and parallel. Well
angulated. Strong bone.
Upper thigh: Long and muscular. Good angulation between pelvis
and upper thigh.
Stifle: Well angulated
Lower thigh: Long, well muscled and sinewy. Its length is almost
equal to that of the upper thigh. Good angulation between lower
thigh and metatarsus.
Hock joint: Strong, dry and sinewy, rather well let down.


FCI-St. N°57  / 13.09.2000
Metatarsus: Vertical, short and dry.
Hind feet: Similar to forefeet.

GAIT/MOVEMENT: The typical gait is an animated, light-footed
trot, elegant and far reaching, with much drive and corresponding
reach.  Not exhausting gallop when working in the field. The back is
firm and the topline remains level. Good, upright carriage. Pacing
undesirable.

SKIN: Tightly fitting, without folds. The skin is well pigmented.

### COAT


Hair: Short and dense, should be coarse and hard at the touch. On the
head and the leathers, it should be thinner, silkier and shorter. The
hair underneath the tail should be slightly, but not noticeably, longer.
It should cover all of the body; the underside of the belly is a little
lighter coated. No undercoat.

Colour: Various shades of russet gold and dark sandy gold
(semmelgelb). The leathers may be a little darker, otherwise uniform
in colour. Red, brownish or lightened colour is undesirable. A little
white patch on the chest or at the throat, not more than 5 cm in
diameter, as well as white markings on the toes are not considered
faulty. The colour of the lips and the eyerims corresponds to the
colour of the nose.

### SIZE/WEIGHT:


Height at withers: Dogs:     58 - 64 cm

Bitches: 54 - 60 cm

It is ineffective to increase the height at the withers. A medium size
should be aimed at. Overall balance and symmetry are much more
important than the mere measurable size.




FCI-St. N°57  / 13.09.2000
FAULTS: Any departure from the foregoing points should be
considered a fault and the seriousness with which the fault should be
regarded should be in exact proportions to its degree and its effect
upon the health and welfare of the dog.

Aggressive or overly shy dogs.
•
Any dog clearly showing physical or behavioural abnormalities.
