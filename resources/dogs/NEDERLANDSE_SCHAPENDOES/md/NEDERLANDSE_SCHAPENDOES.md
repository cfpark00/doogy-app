### NEDERLANDSE SCHAPENDOES


(Dutch Schapendoes)





St-FCI n°313/14.04.1999
TRANSLATION: Mrs Chris Seidler.  Official language (EN).

ORIGIN: Netherlands.

### DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THE OFFICIAL VALID



### STANDARD: 26.03.1992.



UTILIZATION: The Nederlandse Schapendoes is a herding dog
which was used for herding flocks of sheep and which is still used in
the same capacity today.  As pasture for sheep is situated mainly in
quiet, lonely areas of the country, it is necessary for the Schapendoes
to be equipped with great endurance, mobility and speed.  A great
facility for jumping is essential, as well as intelligence and the ability
to act on his own.  He has to be a true herding dog in character, body
and soul.

### FCI-CLASSIFICATION:


Group 1
Sheepdogs and

(except Swiss cattledogs).

Sheepdogs.

Without working trial.

BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: At the end of the last and
beginning of this century, the Nederlandse Schapendoes occurred
everywhere in the region of the Netherlands where there was
heathland and where there were herds or flocks of sheep.  The
shepherds valued him for the tireless pleasure he took in his work
and for his intelligence.  He belongs to the wide-ranging group of
long-haired herding breeds which have densely coated heads.  He is
related to the Bearded Collie, the Puli, the Owczarek Nizinny, the
Bobtail, the Briard, the Bergamasker and the German Schafspudel of
the variety which occurs in Hessen, Odenwald and the Niederrhein
district.  All these similar dogs are smaller mutations of mountain
dogs.  The canine authority, P.M.C. Toepoel, is the founder of this
breed.  During the second World War, he knew how to rouse interest
in the breed.



St-FCI n°313/14.04.1999
During the years from 1940 to 1945 specimen of the almost vanished
Schapendoes were used for breeding from wherever they could be
found.
The Breed Club for Nederlandse Schapendoes was founded in the
year 1947 and in 1952 the breed was provisionally recognized by the
Raad van Beheer.  In 1954 the standard was set up and a Stud Book
started.  Definite recognition followed in the year 1971.  Since then
only registered dogs have been bred from.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: The Nederlandse Schapendoes is a
lightly built, long coated dog with a height at withers of 40 to 50 cm.
His movement is effortless and springy.  He is remarkable jumper.

BEHAVIOUR / TEMPERAMENT: The Schapendoes is a
normally and harmonically constructed herding dog with an attentive
and courageous character.  He is intelligent, watchful, jolly, lively,
friendly and high spirited.  Towards people familiar to him, he
develops great affection and loyalty.

HEAD: The abundant growth of hair gives the head the appearance
of loocking bigger and, in particular, broader.

### CRANIAL REGION:


Skull: Almost flat with a moderate frontal furrow and strongly
defined superciliary arches.  It ist fairly broad in proportion to its
length:  the width is slightly greater than the distance between the
stop and the occiput.
Stop: Clearly defined but not steep.


### FACIAL REGION:


Nose: The bridge of the nose is placed a little lower than the line of
the skull.
Muzzle: The muzzle is shorter than the distance between the stop and
the occiput.  The foreface tapers hardly, remains deep and ends
broadly, being only slightly rounded at its end.  Seen from the side,
with jaw closed, the lower jaw must be clearly visible.



St-FCI n°313/14.04.1999
Teeth:  Normally developed scissor bite.
Cheeks: The zygomatic arches are strongly prominent.

EYES: The eyes are fairly large, round and set into the socket in a
normal position.  They are placed more to the front than the side of
the head.  Their colour is brown; they should not give the impression
of being black.  The white of the eye should only be visible when the
dog looks hard to one side.  The expression is open minded, honest
and lively.  Shape, colour and expression are very characteristic for
the breed.

EARS: These are set on fairly high and are neither large nor fleshy.
They hang free, but not close to the head.  They are amply feathered
and mobile, but should not protrude beyond the outline of the skull.

NECK: The head is carried high on a strong, clean neck.


BODY: The Schapendoes is slightly longer than high.  The skeleton
is fine boned, pliable and elastic.
Topline: Curved over a strong muscular loin.
Chest: Deep.  Ribs are moderately to well sprung; they reach far
back.
Lower lone and Belly: Not too tucked up.

TAIL: The tail is long, well coated and feathered.  The manner and
way in which the dog carries his tail is characteristic of the breed.  In
repose it hangs downwards.  When trotting, the tail is carried fairly
high and swings slightly curved from one side to the other.  When
galloping, it is stretched out straight.  When jumping, the tail
definitely serves as a rudder.  When the dog is alert, the tail may
sometimes be raised high.  It should, however, never be carried
stiffly over the back.

### LIMBS



FOREQUARTERS:  The front legs are straight and lightly boned.
Good angulation of the front legs should emphasize the fore-chest.
Pasterns: Springy.
Forefeet: The feet are fairly large and elastic, broad and oval in
shape.  The toes are tightly bunched.  The pads are thick and springy,
with plentiful hair between them.  Dewclaws are permitted.

### HINDQUARTERS:


Pelvis: In a well slanted position.
Hocks: Moderately angulated, well-muscled.
Metatarsus: Short.
Hind feet: The feet are fairly large and elastic, broad and oval in
shape.  The toes are tightly bunched.  The pads are thick and springy,
with plentiful hair between them.  Dewclaws are permitted.

GAIT / MOVEMENT: In his work, the Schapendoes gallops rather
than trots, so his movement must be light footed and springy without
excessive use of energy.  He must be able to jump well and turn
swiftly.

### COAT


Hair: The Schapendoes has a thick coat with sufficient undercoat.
The coat is long, a good 7 cm or more in the region of the
hindquarters.  It is not smooth, but lightly waved.  Definitely curly,
frizzy hair is not permitted.  The hairs grow very densely together;
they are fine and dry, but above all, never silky.  The coat, where it is
long, is inclined to stand off in tufts, giving the Schapendoes a large
girth, especially at the rear.  The Schapendoes has a tremendous top
knot, moustache and beard.

Colour: All colours are permitted.  Preference is given to blue-grey
to black.
