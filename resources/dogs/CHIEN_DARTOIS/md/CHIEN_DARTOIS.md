### CHIEN D’ARTOIS


(Artois Hound)



.


FCI-St. N° 28 / 25.11.1996

TRANSLATION: Mrs. Peggy Davis.  Official language (FR).

ORIGIN: France.

### DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THE OFFICIAL VALID



### STANDARD: 24.07.1996.



UTILIZATION: The Artois Hound is a Briquet (small type),
nowadays especially used in hunting with the gun.  He drives the
game closer taking advantage of their faults with cleverness, and his
speed is average but maintained.
•
In the country: Because of his acute sense of smell, he is
capable of out manoeuvring the tricks of the hare.
•
In the wood: With his incontestable qualities of a hunter, in
the sparse and well scattered groups of tall trees, he hunts a
deer beautifully in the desired direction.
•
In the thicket: his intrepidity and bravery means that he can
stir up and even obstinate boar.
•
Moreover: He is a hardy animal, endowed with a marvellous
tongue in a high pitched voice which can be heard from far
away.  Six to eight tricolour matching Artois hounds
constitute a small pack susceptible of giving pleasure to a
most demanding huntmaster.

### FCI-CLASSIFICATION:


Group 6
Scenthounds, and related
breeds.

Section 1.2 Medium
sized
scent
hounds.

With working trial.

BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: This breed, formerly named
Picard, was much appreciated in ancient hunting at the time of Henri
IV and Louis XIII and much sought after.  Selincourt already made
much of it, wondering and amazed to see these dogs pulling in a hare
which had passed by one hour ago in dry weather.


FCI-St. N° 28 / 25.11.1996
Le Couteulx de Canteleu, in Manuel de Vénerie Française (1890),
(Manual of French Hunting (1890)), praises also the Artois Hound.
He reports that the artesien breed of his time was crossbred and
difficult to find pure but, in spite of that, it still remained one of the
best breeds for hare hunting.  He has taken care, however, of placing
representatives of the breed in the big kennel of the Jardin
d’Acclimatation, so that it would be know by the general public.  At
the end of the XIXth century and at the beginning of our century, M.
Levoir in Picardy has attempted the re-establishment of the old
Artois type without really succeeding.  During that period and until
the beginning of the First World War, it was another Picard breeder,
M. Mallard, who dominated the raising of the breed.  But if he
produced very pretty dogs, as witnessed by his numerous awards in
canine shows, they were not always in the type conformed with the
description given by the old authors.  After the second World War, it
was believed that the Artois Hound was one of the breeds lost for
ever.  But at the beginning of the 1970s M. Audrechy, of Buigny les
Gamaches in the Somme, has fixed as a task to reconstitue the
kennel.  It is thanks to his efforts and those of Mme Pilat that this
breed regains its place amongst the scenthounds.
