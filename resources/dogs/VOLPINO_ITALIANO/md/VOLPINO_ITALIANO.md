UTILIZATION: Guard and companion dog.

FCI-CLASSIFICATION:  Group  5  Spitz and primitive type.

Section 4 European Spitz.

Without working trial.

BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: The Volpino is one of the
descendants of the European Spitz that already existed in the central
region of our continent since the Bronze Age and of which skeleton
fossils have been discovered around the foundation piles of the
dwellings on stilts. So the Volpino goes back to the same ancestors as
the German Spitz of which he is not a descendant, but a relative. He
has been bred in Italy since immemorial times and has been idolized
in the palaces of the noblemen as well as in the hovels of the common
people, where he was especially appreciated because of his instinct of
guard and vigilance. Work by Vittore Carpaccio from 1502 shows a
Volpino in the Venetian painting, The vision of St Austin. Volpino was
the dog of Michelangelo, and in the 18th century, the tireless
companion of the carters of Tuscany and Latium, always ready to
noisily announce any strangers met on the roads. The standard was
written in 1913 and the breed was fairly popular during the first part
of the 20th century but then it disappeared. Some white specimens
appeared again in 1968 and the Volpino were registered again in 1972.
Even the earlier well-known red colour is seen again.

Hair: Dense, very long and exceptionally straight and standing-off. Of
harsh texture with straight stiff guard hairs; must never be falling flat
but be upstanding even when there is not of a lot of coat. The body
gives the impression of being wrapped up in a muff, particularly on
the neck where the coat forms an abundant collar, but not like a mane.
The skull is covered with semi-long hairs that hide the base of the ears.
Hair is short on the muzzle. On the ears, the hair is very fine and
smooth. The tail is covered with very long hair. On the backside of the
hindquarters, the coat forms trousers.

tolerated/accepted. The white colour should be clear white with a
depth like milk. The red colour is of an intense deer-red. In solid red
