BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: This breed is said to have
originated from medium-sized Japanese dogs that accompanied
migrants from Honshu (the main island of Japan) to Hokkaido during
the Kamakura era (in the 1140s), when exchanges were developing
between Hokkaido and the Tohoku District.  When the breed was
designated as a « natural monument » in 1937, it took an the name of
the area.  It also came to be known as the « Ainu-ken », since the
Ainu-the former inhabitants of Hokkaido-used to breed these dogs
for hunting bears and other animals.  The physique of the Hokkaido
enables it to withstand severe cold and heavy snowfalls.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: Medium-sized dog with sexual
dimorphism strongly marked, well balanced, sturdily built and well
boned.  Muscles tough and clean cut.

• Length of skull equal to width of cheeks.

BEHAVIOUR / TEMPERAMENT: Dog of noteworthy endurance,
showing dignity and naive feeling.  The temperament is faithful,
