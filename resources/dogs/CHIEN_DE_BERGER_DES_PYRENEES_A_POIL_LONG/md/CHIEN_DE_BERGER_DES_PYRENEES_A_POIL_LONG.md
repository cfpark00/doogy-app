BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: Coming from humble
beginnings, it was practically unknown to the official dog scene until
the early 20th century.  Its type varies considerably from one valley to
the next, its shape, its coat can be very different, but its character and
behaviour never vary.  The first official standard was drawn up
between 1921 and 1925 by Mr. Bernard Sénac-Lagrange. It was
first modified under his presidency and then under those of
Messrs. Charles Duconte (1954-1986), Guy Mansencal (19862000) and Alain Pécoult (since 2000-…) in close collaboration
with Raymond Triquet since 2001.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: Dog displaying a maximum of
nervous energy in a minimum of size and weight.  An ever alert
physiognomy, a knowing air combined with great liveliness of
movement give this dog a characteristic appearance unlike any other.





St-FCI n°141/25.05.2009


### IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS:


•
Skull is about as long as wide.
•
Muzzle is shorter than skull in ratio: muzzle 2, skull 3.
•
Length of body is greater than height at withers.
•
Distance from elbow to ground is greater than half height at
withers.

BEHAVIOUR / TEMPERAMENT:  It is a courageous, resourceful
little dog, showing initiative ant totally devoted to its master. It is
headstrong by nature and firm control is usually needed to channel
its energy and bring out the best of its intelligence liveliness. It is
often wary of strangers.

HEAD: Triangular in shape.

### CRANIAL REGION:


Skull: Moderately developed, almost flat, with a scarcely noticeable
central furrow, harmoniously rounded on the sides, showing a very
slight occipital protuberance. Approximately as long as it is wide.
Front section slopes gently to the muzzle.
Stop: Scarcely discernible.

### FACIAL REGION:


Nose: Black.
Muzzle: Straight, a little shorter than the skull, tapering like a wedge
but without a pointed tip.
Lips: Not very thick, covering the lower jaw completely and showing
no apparent corners.  Edges and palate are black or heavily marked
with black.
Jaws/Teeth: Complete dentition.  Strong canines.  Scissor bite (upper
incisors covering lower incisors without loss of contact).  Pincer bite
(edge to edge) is tolerated.

EYES: Expressive, slightly almond-shaped and dark brown.
Neither protruding nor sunken. Wall eyes are accepted in dogs
having blue with black mottling (harlequin or slate grey) coats of
which they are almost always a characteristic.



St-FCI n°141/25.05.2009

Eye rims are black whatever the coat colour.

EARS : They must be rather short, moderately broad at the base and
not set too close to each other at the top of the skull, but not set too
far apart either. They are triangular, fine and ending in a point;
dropped, flat and very mobile. When alert, seen from the front,
the top edge notably prolongs the transversal line of the skull.
They may also be half-pricked; in which case the lower part must
be pricked and mobile, and ideally the top third or half of the ear
should fall forward to the front or the side, symmetrically for both
ears.

NECK: Rather long and muscled, springing well up from shoulders.

BODY: The bone structure is strong without heaviness, muscle is
lean.
Topline: Well-supported.
Withers: Prominent.
Back: Rather long and strong.
Loin: Short, slightly arched, but seems more so because coat is often
thicker on hindquarters and croup.
Croup: Fairly short and rather oblique.
Chest: Moderately developed, reaching to elbow.  The ribs are
slightly rounded
Flank: Scarcely descending.

TAIL: Well fringed, not very long, set rather low and with a hooked
tip. When the dog is alert, the tail should, in general, hardly rise
above the topline, however it may curve forward. In countries
where this practice is not forbidden by law, some dogs are docked.
A rudimentary tail is permitted.

### LIMBS



### FOREQUARTERS:


General appearance: Upright, lean, sinewy, well-fringed.
Shoulder: Rather long, moderately oblique.
Upper arm: Oblique and moderately long.
Forearm: Straight.
Carpus (carpal joint): Noticeable wrist joint.
Metacarpus (pasterns): Slightly oblique seen from the side.
Forefeet: Lean, fairly flat, of a definite oval shape. Dark pads. Small
hard nails covered by hair which is also found under the foot,
between the pads.

### HINDQUARTERS:


General appearance: Rather closed angulation.  Semi-long coated
dogs have no fringing on limbs.
Upper thigh: Not very long, moderately oblique, strong, well-defined
muscle.
Stifle (knee): Well-angulated and parallel to the body.
Lower thigh: Rather long and oblique.
Hock joint: Lean, set low, well angulated, hocks are sometimes a
little close.
Metatarsus (Rear pastern): Perpendicular to the ground or very
slightly oblique from back to front.
Hind feet: Lean, fairly flat, of a definite oval shape.  Dark pads.
Small hard nails covered by hair which is also found under the foot,
between the pads.
Dewclaws: Single or double dewclaws are acceptable on hind legs as
is their absence.

GAIT / MOVEMENT: Walking, the Pyrenean Sheepdog has a
rather short stride. The trot, preferred pace of the Pyrenean Sheepdog
should be free and vigorous.  At a gentle trot, the head is carried
fairly high, when the speed increases, the head is in line with the
back.  The feet are never raised high, the movement is flowing, the
dog skims over the ground.




St-FCI n°141/25.05.2009
SKIN: Thin, often marbled with dark patches, irrespective of coatcolour.

### COAT


Hair: Long, or semi-long, but always dense, almost flat or slightly
wavy, thicker and woollier on the croup and thighs, texture
somewhere between goat’s hair and sheep’s wool.  In some dogs the
mixture of coarse and woolly hair can produce sorts of strands or
cords called “cadenettes" and sometimes matted or felted hair called
“matelotes” which overlap like tiles on the croup.  “Cadenettes” can
be found on the chest and the forelegs at elbow level. The muzzle has
shorter, less dense hair.
On  the end of the muzzle, and sometimes along the whole muzzle, it
is laid flat and set from front to back. On the sides as well as on the
cheeks, the hair is longer and brushed up in a windswept way from
front to back.  Eyes must be clearly visible and not covered by hair.

Colour: Fawn, lighter or darker, overlaid with black or not and
sometimes with a little white on the chest and on the limbs; grey,
lighter or darker, often with some white on the head, chest and limbs;
blue with black mottling (harlequin or slate blue).
There are also brindle, black coats and or black with white markings
(limited spotting).  Solid colours are preferred.

### SIZE:


Height at withers:  Males
from  42 cm to 48 cm.

Females from  40 cm to 46 cm.
A tolerance of + or - 2 cm is allowed for perfectly typed specimens.

FAULTS: Any departure from the foregoing points should be
considered a fault and the seriousness with which the fault should be
regarded should be in exact proportion to its degree and its effect
upon the health and welfare of the dog.
