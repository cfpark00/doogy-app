BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: Present in the Pyrenees from
time immemorial, known in the Middle Ages and used as a guardian
of castles, it is mentioned by Gaston Phoebus in the 14th century.
Already appreciated as a companion dog in the 17th century, it
reached glorious heights at the court of Louis XIV.  The first detailed
description of this breed dates from 1897 in the book by Count de
Bylandt. Ten years later the first breed clubs were set up and in 1923
the Réunion of Pyrenean Dog Fanciers ( Réunion des Amateurs de
Chiens Pyrénées – R.A.C.P.), at the instigation of Mr Bernard SénacLagrange, registered the official standard with the SCC (Société
Centrale Canine, French K.C.) the current standard is still very close
to the standard worked out in 1923, only a few clarifying
amendments having been made.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: Dog of great size, imposing and
strongly built, but not without a certain elegance.




FCI-St. N° 137 / 31.03.2005


### IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS:


•
The widest part of the skull is equal to its length.
•
The muzzle is slightly Shorter than the skull.
•
The length of the body from the point of the shoulder to the
point of the buttock is slightly greater than the height of the
dog at the withers.
•
The depth of the chest is equal to, or slightly less than, half
the height at the withers.

BEHAVIOUR / TEMPERAMENT: Used on its own to guarantee
the protection of flocks from attacks by predators, its selection
depended on its aptitude for guarding and dissuading as much as on
its attachment to the flock.  The resulting main qualities are strength
and agility, allied to gentleness and attachment to those it is
protecting.  This protecting dog has a propensity for independence
and a sense of initiative which demand a certain degree of authority
from its owner.

HEAD: Not too large in comparison with the size of the dog.  Its
sides are fairly flat.

### CRANIAL REGION:


Skull: The widest part of the skull is equal to its length. It is slightly
rounded due to the sagittal crest being perceptible to the touch.
Because the occipital protuberance is apparent, the back of the skull
has on ogival shape. Superciliary ridges are not pronounced. The
median furrow is scarcely perceptible to the touch between the eyes.
Stop: Gentle slope.

### FACIAL REGION:


Nose: Totally black.
Muzzle: Broad, slightly shorter than the skull, narrowing
progressively towards the tip.  Seen from above it forms a blunt “V”.
Well filled below the eyes.
Lips: Not very droopy, just enough to cover the lower jaw. Black or
heavily marked with black, as is the palate.


FCI-St. N° 137 / 31.03.2005
Jaws/Teeth:  Complete dentition with healthy, white teeth.  Scissors
bite (upper incisors overlapping lower incisors without losing
contact).  Pincer bite tolerated as are the two lower pincers tipping
forward.

EYES: Rather small, almond-shaped, set slightly obliquely, with
intelligent and contemplative expression, of amber-brown colour.
Eyelids never loose. Gentle, dreamy look.

EARS: Set on level with the eye, fairly small, triangular in shape and
rounded at the tip.  They fall flat against the head and are carried
slightly raised when the dog is alert.

NECK: Strong, relatively short,  with very little dewlap

BODY: The length of the body from the point of the shoulder
to the point of the buttock is slightly greater than the height of the
dog at the withers.  The distance between the sternum and the ground
is approximately half the height at the withers, never less.
Topline: Well-supported.
Withers: Broad.
Back: Of good length and strong.
Loin: Of moderate length.
Croup: Slightly oblique with fairly prominent haunches.
Flank: Scarcely pronounced.
Chest: Not too low, but broad and long.  Let down as far as the
elbow but not lower.  Its height is equal to or slightly less than half
the height of the dog at the withers.  The ribs are slightly rounded.

TAIL: It reaches at least as far as the point of the hock. It is bushy
and forms a plume. Carried low in repose with its tip forming a hook
for preference. When the dog is alert,  the tail rises towards the back,
forming a strong circle with only the tip touching the loins (making
the wheel “arroundera” to quote the expression used by the people of
the Pyrenees).
