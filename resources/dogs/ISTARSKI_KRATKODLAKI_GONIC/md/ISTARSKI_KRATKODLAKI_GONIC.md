FCI-CLASSIFICATION: Group  6
Scenthounds and related


breeds.
Section 1.2 Medium sized scenthounds
With working trial.

BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: The breed descents from an
old type of the “East Adriatic white hound with markings”. The
earliest proof of this can be seen in the Franciscan monastery in
Dubrovnik, which originates from the time between 1327 and 1348.
The Capital column of four dogs shows the old type of this hound.
The Istrian Short Haired Hound can be found on a painting from the
year 1474 “The bow of the three kings” in the cemetery chapel next
to the village of Beram (Istrien). The altar painting from the year
1476 “The mother of Mercifulness” in the church of the holy Francis
in Zadar, where in the left bottom corner an ancestor of today’s
Istrian Hound is shown. He was shown then with a three-coloured
coat. The description of this hound can be found in the manuscript of
the Dakovoe Bishop Petar Bakic from the year 1719, where it says
that the breeding of the Istrian Hound was already known before the
14th century. The first Standard for the Short-haired Istrian Hound
was published by the FCI on the 2nd of April 1955.

on the head is desirable. The markings on the body can be anywhere,
mostly on the back, on the ribcage and around the tail set. Markings

must not get uneven or paler towards the edges of the markings.
