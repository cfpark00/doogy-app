BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: Since ancient times, seafaring
from East to West in the Mediterranean region has led to the
exchange of culture and science between nations.  These reciprocal
relations, even though mainly of a commercial nature, also gave the
opportunity for an exchange of domestic animals.  Amongst these
were watch and guard dogs which were needed in harbours and
coastal settlements as a protection against pirates and robbers coming
in by sea.  Amongst these mostly large, strong, resistant dogs with
large heads and powerful teeth, one type distinguished itself.  It was
the mastiff of the Iberian Peninsula, which, in Spain, was used in
various areas as a hunting or as a fighting dog against bulls and other
dogs.  This breed accompanied King Jacob 1 on his conquests and
arrived in the Balearics about the year 1230.  In the 17th century,
Minorca and others areas came into British possession, following the
treaty of Utrecht.  The British brought their own fighting and guard
dogs with them into the Balearics and crossed them with the native
mastiffs of the Iberian Peninsula, which also occurred in the Balearic
Isles.



FCI-St. N° 249 / 13.06.1997
In the beginning of the 18th century, fights between dogs and bulls
(bull baiting) were very popular and the Britons inhabiting the Island
looked for a breed which would be held suited to such fights.  These
circumstances explain the name “Ca de Bou”, Bull Dog.  In the
Spanish Stud Book for the year 1923, the existence of this breed is
already established.
The first official entry was in the year 1928 and in 1929, when such a
breed was exhibited for the first time at a Dog Show in Barcelona.

GENERAL APPEARANCE:  A typical Molossian of somewhat
elongated build, strong and powerful, of medium size.  The
difference between the sexes is apparent in the head, whose
circumference is definitely greater in dogs than in bitches.

BEHAVIOUR / TEMPERAMENT: Quiet by nature, he can under
some circumstances be courageous and brave.  He is at ease with
people, faithful and devoted to his master.  As a watch and guard
dog, he is unsurpassed.  In quiet situations, he is trusting and self
assured.  When roused, his expression is piercing.

HEAD: Strong and massive.

### CRANIAL REGION:


Skull: Large, broad and almost square.  Its circumference, specially
in males, is greater than the chest measurement taken at the withers.
Forehead is broad and flat.  Frontal furrow well defined.  Seen from
the front, due to the shape of the skull, back of skull is not visible.
Upper planes of skull and muzzle are almost parallel, lightly
converging.
Stop: Seen from side, strongly defined and protruding; seen from
front, only noticeable because the eyebrow arches form a definite
frontal furrow.

FACIAL REGION: The jaw muscles are strong, protruding, well
developed and reach to the middle region below the eye.  Even
though there are some folds which occur sideways over the chewing
muscles, there are altogether no folds in the skin of the head.


FCI-St. N° 249 / 13.06.1997
Nose: Black and broad.  The philtrum between the nostrils is well
defined.
Muzzle: Set on at inner corner of eye, broad and conical, in profile
reminiscent of a blunt cone with a broad base.  The nasal bridge is
staight, rising slightly.  Length of muzzle is in proportion of 1 to 3 to
length of skull.
Lips: Laterally the upper lip covers the lower lip to the middle part of
the muzzle, where the corner of the mouth appears.  The upper lip is
rather taut, whereas the lower lip is folded in its middle part, so that
in a closed muzzle, the lips are not noticeable.  The completely red
mucous membrane of the mouth cavity has distinct transversal ridges
and the rims of the gums have black pigment.
Jaws/Teeth: The jaws are strong, incisors in a correct row and
canines well apart.  The mouth is complete, teeth white and strong.
The bite is undershot; the gap of the not exaggerated undershot bite
should not be more than 1 cm.  When the muzzle is closed, teeth
must not be visible.

EYES: Large, oval in shape, lids wide open, clearly outlined and
slightly slanting. Colour should be as dark as possible and according
to coat colour.  Conjunctiva not visible.  Looked at from front, white
of eyes should not be visible.  The eyes are deep set and far apart.

EARS: Set on high and to the sides, rather small, with inner ear
opening visible and drawn backwards in a curve; it is a so called
“rose ear”.  In repose, the tip of the ear is below the line of the eye.

NECK: Strong, thick, in harmony to the whole.  At set on, roughly
the diameter of the head; fitting well into withers.  Skin slightly
loose; thin dewlap permitted.

### BODY:


Loins and flanks: Short, relatively narrow, with definite arch towards
croup.
Croup: 1 to 2 cm higher in position than withers.  Slanting to
horizontal at an angle of 30 degrees and slightly narrower than chest.


FCI-St. N° 249 / 13.06.1997
Chest: The rib cage is somewhat cylindrical, deep and reaches to the
elbows.  As the tops of the shoulder blades are wide apart, the chest
is broad at the height of the withers.
Lower line: The chest line runs parallel to the ground. The belly line
rises and is tucked up lightly, not greyhound-like.

TAIL: Low set on.  Thick at root, tapering towards the tip.  Hangs
naturally in repose; in action it forms a slight curve and is raised to
height of the top line.


### LIMBS



### FOREQUARTERS:


Shoulders: Moderately short, slightly, slanting, hardly protruding.
Upper arm: Straight, parallel, set well apart.
Elbow: Standing away from the chest because of width of breast but
in no way turned out.

Forefeet: Strong with thick, close together, lightly rounded toes.
Pads slightly pigmented.

HINDQUARTERS: Muscles broader than in forequarters.
Upper thigh: Broad, naturally angulated.

slight dewlap may occur.
