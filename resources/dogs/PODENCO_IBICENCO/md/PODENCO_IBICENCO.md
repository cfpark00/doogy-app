### PODENCO IBICENCO




FCI-St. N° 89 / 04.02.2000
TRANSLATION: C.Seidler. Official language (ES).

ORIGIN: Spain (Balearic Islands).

### DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THE OFFICIAL VALID



### STANDARD: 26.05.1982.



UTILIZATION: The Podenco Ibicenco is mainly used for hunting
rabbits without guns, by day and  at night.  Thanks to his particularly
good scenting ability, which, coupled with hearing, he uses more
than sight, he scents and hunts out rabbits with ease, even in dense
cover.  Nimble and bright, he catches his prey quickly, specially
when hunting together with other dogs.  When one dog indicates
game, he is surrounded by all the others, which keep a certain
distance and stand in wait.  They bark only when they see or hear the
game and when they have surrounded it.  Both when indicating and
catching game, all dogs wag their tail fast, but are easily put off their
waiting attitude.  The Podenco Ibicenco is also used for hunting hare
and large game.  He is a good retriever.  With certain exceptions only
bitches are used for the formation of a pack or, at most, with one
male only, as the latter do not work together during a hunt and are
quarrelsome.  When a pack has caught several thousand rabbits, it
can happen with this breed, that some dogs from the same pack no
longer want to hunt until they have had a considerable rest. The
Spanish expression « enconillarse » (go to rest) refers to this
peculiarity.

BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY:  This breed originates in the
Balearic Islands of Majorca, Ibiza, Minorca and Formentera, where it
is known by the original name of « Ca Eivissec ».



FCI-St. N° 89 / 04.02.2000
It is also widely found in Catalonia, round Valencia, in the
Roussillon and in the Provence, where it is known by the names
Mallorquí, Xarnelo, Mayorquais, Charnegue, Charnegui and Balearic
Dog.  Probably these dogs were brought to the islands by the
Phoenecians, Carthaginians and eventually also the Romans.
This dog is a typical primitive and robust representative of one of the
oldest still existing breeds.  Illustrations of these dogs are found in
the graves of the Pharaohs and on objects in museums, so that the
existence of the breed can already be proved in the year 3400 BC.

IMPORTANT PROPORTION: The distance from the tip of the
muzzle to the eyes is equal to that from the eyes to the occiput.

HEAD: Seen as a whole, the long, fine head has the appearance of a
cone cut off near its base; completely dry, rather small in relation to
body.

### CRANIAL REGION:


Skull: Long and flat (dolichocephalic).  Occipital bone protruding.
Forehead fine and flat.
Stop: Barely pronounced.

### FACIAL REGION:

and according to colour of coat, flesh colour.
Lips: Thin,close fitting, flesh colour.
Teeth: Perfect fitting bite, scissor bite, white and regular.

EYES: Slanting, small, light amber colour, reminiscent of caramel
colour.  The amber colour can be more or less intensive according to
coat colour.  Without seeming very noble, the expression shows
intelligence but also fear and mistrust.

EARS: Always stiff, very mobile.  Pointing forward or sideways in a
horizontal plane or held backwards.  Upright when dog is animated.
The center of the ear set on is level with the eyes.


FCI-St. N° 89 / 04.02.2000

by a third of its long diagonal.  They are fine without hair on the
inside of the ear opening; of medium, not exaggerated size.

NECK: Very dry, both in its upper and lower part.  Its length is a
quarter the length of the body, slightly arched and muscular.  Skin is
taut, smooth, without dewlap.  Normally, the coat is longer and
denser in the region of the set on to the body, especially in the
smooth variety.

more or less tightly curved.  Preferably not carried upright or too
