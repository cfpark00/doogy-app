### IRISH RED & WHITE SETTER




FCI-St. N°330 / 15.06. 2005

ORIGIN: Ireland.

### DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THE OFFICIAL VALID



### STANDARD: 19.04.2005.



UTILIZATION: Most acceptable companion and friend in the
homes and the fields. The Irish Red & White Setter is bred primarily
for the field. The standard as set out hereunder must be interpreted
chiefly from this point of view and all Judges at bench shows must
judge the exhibits chiefly from the working standpoint.


### FCI-CLASSIFICATION:


Group  7 Pointing Dogs

Section 2 British and Irish Pointers



and Setters.

With Working Trial.

BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY:  The Irish Setter probably
came to its own at the end of the 17th century. It is not well known
outside of Ireland that there are two breeds of Irish Setters, but is
fairly certain, that the Red and White Setter is the older of the two,
and that judicious selective breeding evolved the solid red colour.
When Irish Setters came to the show benches, just past the middle of
the 19th century, there was a good deal of confusion about their
proper colour. By the end of the 19th century, the Red Setter had
virtually eclipsed the Red and White, which became so rare, that they
were thought to be extinct. During the 1920s, efforts were made to
revive the breed. By 1944, the breed had re-established itself well
enough to have a club of its own, and today it can be seen in healthy
numbers at Irish shows and Field Trials. The present Club the Irish
Red & White Setter Field & Show Society was formed in 1981 and
through its endeavours and direction the breed is now well
established nationally and internationally. The Irish Red & White
Setter competes successfully in Field Trials against the other
pointing breeds and there are now quite a number of Field Trial
Champions and Show Champions.

### COAT


Hair: Long silky fine hair called "Feathering" on the back of the fore
and hind legs and on the outer ear flap, also a reasonable amount on
the flank extending on to the chest and throat forming a fringe. All
feathering straight, flat and free from curl but slight wave is
permissible.  The tail should be well feathered.  On all other parts of
the body the hair should be short, flat and free from curl.

Colour: Base colour white with solid red patches (clear islands of red
colour), both colours should show the maximum of life and bloom;
flecking but not roaning permitted around the face and feet and up
the foreleg as far as the elbow and up the hindleg as far as the hock.


FCI-St. N°330 / 15.06. 2005
Roaning,flecking and mottling on any other part of the body is
objectionable.

### SIZE AND WEIGHT:


Desirable Height at the withers: Dogs:    24,5 - 26 ins. (62 - 66 cm).



Bitches: 22,5 - 24 ins. (57 - 61 cm).

FAULTS : Any departure from the foregoing points should be
considered a fault and the seriousness with which the fault should be
regarded should be in exact proportion to its degree and its effect
upon the health and welfare of the dog.

### SEVERE FAULT:


• Any dog or bitch not conforming to the height standard.

### DISQUALIFYING FAULTS:


• Aggressive or overly shy.
• Any dog clearly showing physical or behavioural abnormalities.
• Males not having two apparently normal testicles.
• Although flecking but not roaning is permitted around the face
and feet and up the forelegs as far as the elbow and up the hindleg
as far as the hock, visible and excessive roaning, flecking and
mottling on any other part of the body is an eliminating fault.

### N.B.:


• Male animals should have two apparently normal testicles fully
descended into the scrotum.
• Only functionally and clinically healthy dogs, with breed typical
conformation should be used for breeding.
