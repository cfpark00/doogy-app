BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: The Bangkaew Dog is an old
breed that originated from the Bangkaew village, in Thanang-ngam
area in the Bang-rakam district of Phitsanulok province in Thailand.
The breed traces its ancestry back to a cross between a Buddhist
abbot’s local black & white female dog and a now extinct wild dog
producing today’s breed.
In 1957, selective breeding from single litters produced the
generations seen today. The Thai Bangkaew Dog is regarded as a
precious heritage of Phitsanulok province. The dogs are bred widely
in the province and have become so famous nationwide that they
now are bred in every part of Thailand.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: The Thai Bangkaew Dog is a square
built, well proportioned dog, never low on legs, with fairly wide and
deep chest. It has a double-coat that should form a ruff around the
neck and shoulders and a pluming tail, more pronounced in males
than females. Males have larger bone than females.

### IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS:


Length of body / Height at withers is 1 : 1. Length of legs slightly
superior to depth of chest.
