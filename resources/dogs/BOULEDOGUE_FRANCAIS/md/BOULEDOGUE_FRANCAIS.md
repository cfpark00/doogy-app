BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: Probably descending, like all
mastiffs, from the Epirus and the Roman Empire molossers, relative
of the Bulldog of Great Britain, the Alaunts (tribe of the Middle Ages),
the mastiffs and small-type mastiffs of France. The bulldog we know
is the product of different crossings done by enthusiastic breeders in
the popular quarters of Paris in the 1880s. During that period, the
Bulldog was a dog belonging to Parisian market porters, butchers and
coachmen, it soon won over high society and the artistic world by its
particular appearance and character. It rapidly became popular. The
first breed club was founded in 1880 in Paris. The first registration
dates from 1885 and the first standard was established in 1898, the
year in which the French Kennel Club recognized the French Bulldog
breed. The first dog of this breed was shown at an exhibition as early
as 1887. The standard, modified in 1931-1932 and 1948, was
reformulated in 1986 by H.F. Reant with the collaboration of R.
Triquet (F.C.I. publication 1987), then in 1994 by Violette Guillon
(F.C.I. publication 1995) and in 2012 by the French Bulldog Club
committee.




FCI-St. N° 101 / 18.09.2023
GENERAL APPEARANCE: The type is of a small-sized molossian.
A powerful dog for its small size, short, stocky, compact in all its
proportions, smooth-coated, with a snub nose, erect ears and a
naturally short tail. Must have the appearance of an active, intelligent,
very muscular dog, of compact build with a solid bone structure. No
point is exaggerated compared to the others, which could spoil the
dog’s general harmony, in appearance and in movement.

IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS: The length of the body – between
the point of the shoulder and the point of the buttock – slightly
surpasses the height at the withers. Short face.

BEHAVIOUR / TEMPERAMENT: Sociable, lively, playful,
possessive, and keen companion dog.

HEAD: Must be strong, broad and square, covered by the skin of the
head which forms symmetrical folds and wrinkles, without excess.

### CRANIAL REGION:


Skull: Broad, almost flat from ear to ear, domed forehead. Prominent
superciliary arches, separated by a particularly developed furrow
between the eyes. The furrow must not extend onto the skull.  External
occipital protuberance is barely developed.
Stop: Pronounced.

FACIAL REGION: The head of the Bulldog is characterized by a
shortening of the maxillary-nasal part as well as a slight to moderate
slope of the nose backwards. The nose is slightly upturned (“snub
nose”).
Nose: Black, broad, snubbed, with symmetrical and well opened
nostrils, slanting towards the rear. The slope of the nostrils as well as
the upturned nose must, however, allow normal nasal breathing.
Muzzle:  Short, broad, with concentric symmetrical folds.
Lips: Thick, a little loose and black. The upper lip meets the lower lip
at its middle, completely covering the teeth.
The profile of the upper lip is descending and rounded. The tongue
must never show when the dog is not excited.




FCI-St. N° 101 / 18.09.2023
Jaws/Teeth: Broad and powerful jaws. The lower jaw projects in front
of the upper jaw and turns up. The arch of the lower incisors is
rounded. The jaw must not show lateral deviation, or torsion. The gap
between the incisors of the upper and the lower jaw should not be
strictly delimited, the essential condition being that the upper and the
lower lips meet to completely cover the teeth. The lower incisors
surpass the upper incisors. Sufficiently developed incisors and
canines. Complete bite is desirable.
Cheeks: Well developed.

EYES: Clearly visible eyes, striking with lively expression, set low,
quite far from the nose and the ears, dark coloured, rather large,
rounded, showing no trace of white (sclera) when the dog is looking
straight forward.  Rims of eyelids must be black.

EARS: Medium size, wide at the base and rounded at the top. Set
high on the head, but not too close together, carried erect. The ear is
open towards the front. The skin must be fine and soft to the touch.

NECK: Short, powerful, slightly arched, without dewlap, broadens
towards the shoulder.

### BODY:


Topline: Rising progressively, but not excessively, from the withers
towards the loin. That conformation – also called roach-back – is
typical for the breed.
Back: Broad and muscular, firm without slackness.
Loin: Short, broad and arched.
Croup: Well sloping.
Chest: Cylindrical and well let down (slightly under the elbows); very
well sprung ribs, so-called “barrel shaped”. Fore chest, broad and
square-shaped, seen from the front.
Underline and belly: Tucked up but not whippety.





FCI-St. N° 101 / 18.09.2023
TAIL: Naturally short, ideally long enough to cover the anus, set low,
rather straight, thick at the base and tapering at the tip.
A kinked, knotted, broken or relatively long tail that does not reach
beyond the point of the hocks, is admitted. It is carried low. Even in
action, the tail must not rise above the horizontal.

### LIMBS:



### FOREQUARTERS:


General appearance: Forelegs upright (and straight) seen in profile
and from the front.
Shoulder: Must be well laid back.
Upper arm: Short, thick, muscular, slightly curved.
Elbows: Close and tight to the body.
Forearm: Short, straight and muscular.
Carpus (Wrist): Solid and short.
Metacarpus (Pastern): Short and slightly oblique seen in profile.
Forefeet: Round, compact, of small dimension, i.e. “cat feet”, turning
slightly outward.  The toes are tight, nails short, thick and black.

### HINDQUARTERS:


General appearance: The hindlegs are strong and muscular, a little
longer than the forelegs, thus raising the hindquarters.  The legs are
upright as seen both in profile and from behind.
Thigh: Well muscled, firm.
Hock joint: Quite well let down, neither too angulated nor too straight.
Tarsus: solid.
Metatarsus (Rear pastern): Short.
Hind feet: Round, compact, turning neither inward nor outward.

GAIT/MOVEMENT: The legs moving parallel to the median plane
of the body, whether seen in front or from behind. Free, movement
with good hind leg thrust.

SKIN: Firm.





FCI-St. N° 101 / 18.09.2023


### COAT



Hair: Smooth coat, close, glossy and soft, without undercoat.

Colour: fawn, brindled or not, with or without white spotting.
Coat with colouring:
Brindle: Fawn coat moderately characterized by transversal dark
brindling creating a ‘tiger-marked’ effect, strongly brindled coats
must not cover out the fawn ground colour. A black mask may be
present. Limited white spotting is admissible. Fawn: Solid coat, from
light fawn to dark fawn, sometimes presenting a paler colouring of the
inclined parts, with or without a black mask, although masked subjects
are preferred. Sometimes accompanied by limited white spotting.
Coat with white spotting:
Brindled with moderate or important white spotting: So-called ‘pied’,
the spotting being ideally distributed over the entire subject. Some
blotches on the skin are admissible.
Fawn with moderate or important white spotting: So-called ‘fawn and
white’, the spotting being ideally distributed over the entire dog. Some
blotches of the skin are tolerated. The nose is always black, in all coat
colours, never brown or blue. The all-white subjects provided the edge
of eyelids and nose are black – are admitted but not bred for, because
of a risk of deafness.

### SIZE AND WEIGHT:


Height at the withers: Males: 27–35 cm. Females: 24–32 cm.
A deviation of 1 cm above and below the standard is tolerated.

Weight: Males: 9–14 kg. Females: 8–13 kg.
500 g more than the standard weight is allowed when the subject is
typical.

### FAULTS:


Any departure from the foregoing points should be considered a fault
and the seriousness with which the fault should be regarded should be
in exact proportion to its degree and its effect upon the health and
welfare of the dog.
