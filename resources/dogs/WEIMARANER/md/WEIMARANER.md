### WEIMARANER




FCI-St. N° 99 / 26.05.2015
TRANSLATION: C. Seidler / Official language (DE).

ORIGIN: Germany.

### DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THE OFFICIAL VALID



### STANDARD: 19.03.2015.



UTILIZATION: According to his hunting purpose as a versatile
hunting dog, the Weimaraner must possess all the talents
required of him, and be able to be used for all works in field,
wood and water, in a performance oriented manner, before and
after the shot.

FCI-CLASSIFICATION: Group  7
Pointing Dogs.


Section 1.1   Continental Pointing Dogs,



Type “Braque”.


With working trial.

BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: There are numerous theories
regarding the origin of the Weimaraner Pointing Dog. Only so much
is certain: That the Weimaraner, which at that time still contained a
great deal of liam hound blood (« Leithund ») was already kept at the
Weimar court in the first third of the 19th century. In the middle of
the 19th century, before pure breeding was started, breeding was
mainly in the hands of professional hunters and gamekeepers in
central Germany, mostly in the regions round Weimar and in
Thuringia.  As the days of the lima hounds passed, the dogs were
crossed with the « Hühnerhund » and breeding was continued with
this cross. From about 1890 on, the breed was produced according to
a plan and regarded as suitable for registration in a stud book.  Apart
from the shorthaired Weimaraner, a longhaired variety occurred, if
only singly, since the turn of the 20th century.  Since being admitted
to the studbook, the Weimaraner has been pure bred, remaining
mostly free from crosses with any other breeds, in particular,
Pointers. Therefore the Weimaraner is likely to be the oldest German
« pointing » breed, which has been pure bred since 1900.



FCI-St. N° 99 / 26.05.2015
GENERAL APPEARANCE: Medium to large size hunting dog.
Functional working type, pleasing in shape, sinewy and very
muscular. Difference in type between dogs and bitches easily
distinguished.

### IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS:


Length of body to height at withers approximately 12 : 11.
Proportions of the head; from tip of nose to stop slightly longer than
from stop to occiput. Forequarter distance from elbow to mid-pastern
and distance from elbow to point of withers about equal.

BEHAVIOUR / TEMPERAMENT: Versatile, easily trained steady
and passionate hunting dog. Persevering in systematic search, yet not
too lively. Remarkable ability to pick up scent. Ready to seize game
and other prey; he is a good watchdog, without aggressiveness
however. Reliable pointing dog and worker in water. Remarkable
inclination to work after the shot.

### HEAD



### CRANIAL REGION:


Skull: In balance with size of body and facial region.  Broader in
dogs than bitches, yet in both, the relationship between width of
cranial region to total length of head must be in good proportion.
Median groove on forehead.  Slightly to moderately protruding
occipital bone. Zygomatic arches easily traceable behind the eyes.
Stop: Extremely slight.

### FACIAL REGION:


Nose: Nose leather large, protruding over the under jaw.  Dark flesh
colour, merging gradually into gray towards the rear.
Muzzle: Long and, especially in the male, powerful, seen from
profile appearing almost angular. Region of canines and carnassial
teeth also strong. Bridge of nose straight, often slightly arched, never
with a concave curve.
Lips: Moderately deep, flesh coloured, as are the gums. Slight labial
corner.



FCI-St. N° 99 / 26.05.2015
Jaws/Teeth: Jaws strong; teeth complete, regular and strong. Top and
bottom incisors closely touching scissor bite.
Cheeks: Muscular, clearly defined.

EYES: Amber colour, dark to pale, with intelligent expression. Skyblue in puppies. Round, set barely slanting.  Lids well fitting.

EARS: Broad and fairly long, just reaching to corner of mouth. Set
on high and narrow, forming a rounded off point at tip. In alterness,
turned slightly forward, folded.

NECK: Good carriage. Upper line arched upwards in profile.
Muscular, nearly round, not too short, clean. Becoming stronger
towards the shoulders and merging harmoniously into the topline and
chest.

### BODY:


Topline: From the arched neckline, over the well defined withers the
topline merges gradually into the relatively long back.
Withers: Well defined.
Back: Muscular, without a dip.  Not running up towards the rear. A
slightly longer back, a breed characteristic, is not a fault.
Loin: Broad, muscular, straight to slightly arched, transition from
back to loin well closed.
Croup: Pelvis long and moderately sloped.
Chest: Strong but not unduly broad, with sufficient depth to reach
almost to elbows and of sufficient length. Well sprung without being
barrel-shaped and with long ribs. Forechest well developed.
Underline and belly: Rising slightly, but belly not tucked up.

TAIL: Set on slightly lower than with other similar breeds. Tail
strong and well coated. Carried hanging down in repose. When alert
or working, carried level or higher. In countries where it is allowed
by law, appropriate tail docking is permissible for shorthaired
Weimaraner used for hunting.

close fitting topcoat, thick undercoat and moderately developed
feathering and breeching, sometimes occurs in dogs of mixed
ancestry.

Females:  57 – 65 cm.

Weight:  Males:
about 30 – 40 kg.

Females: about 25 – 35 kg.

FAULTS: Any departure from the foregoing points should be
considered a fault and the seriousness with which the fault should be
regarded should be in exact proportion to its degree and its effect
upon the health and welfare of the dog.
