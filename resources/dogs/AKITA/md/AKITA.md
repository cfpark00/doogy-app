BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY:  Originally Japanese dogs
were small to medium in size and no large breeds existed.  Since
1603 in the Akita region, Akita Matagis (medium-sized bear-hunting
dogs) were used as fighting dogs.  From 1868 Akita Matagis were
crossed with Tosas and Mastiffs.  Consequently, the size of this
breed increased but characteristics associated with Spitz type were
lost.
In 1908 dog fighting was prohibited, but this breed was nevertheless
preserved and improved as a large Japanese breed.  As a result, nine
superior examples of this breed were designated as « Natural
Monuments » in 1931.
During World War II (1939-1945), it was common to use dogs as a
source of fur for military garments.  The police ordered the capture
and confiscation of all dogs other than German Shepherd Dogs used
for military purposes.  Some fanciers tried to circumvent the order by
crossbreeding their dogs with German Shepherd Dogs.
When World War II ended, Akitas had been drastically reduced in
number and existed as three distinct types; 1) Matagi Akitas, 2)
fighting Akitas, and 3) Shepherd Akitas.  This created a very
confusing situation in the breed.
During the restoration process of the pure breed after the war.,
Kongo-go, a dog of the Dewa line, which exhibited characteristics of
the Mastiff and German Shepherd.



FCI-St. N° 255 / 02.04.2001
However, sensible learned fanciers did not approve of this type as a
proper Japanese breed, so they made efforts to eliminate the strain
old foreign breeds by crossbreeding with Matagi Akitas for the
purpose of restoring the original pure breed. They succeeded in
stabilizing the pure strain of large sized breed as known today.
