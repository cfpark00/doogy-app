FCI-CLASSIFICATION: Group 2
Pinscher and Schnauzer-


Molossian breeds - Swiss
Mountain and Cattle Dogs.


Section  1    Pinscher and Schnauzer
type.

Without working trial.

BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: The smooth haired Pinscher
represents a very old breed which was mentioned in the German Stud
Book for dogs in 1880 already. He has the same ancestors as the
Schnauzer which was also called the rough coated Pinscher. From
the beginning the smooth haired Pinschers differed from the rough
haired specimen in their colour and their short coat. They were
mostly black with light brown markings, self coloured in various
shades of brown to red, pepper and salt or simply blue-grey to black.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: The German Pinscher is smoothhaired, medium in size with proud carriage, flowing outlines, elegant
and square build. He is strong like the Schnauzer. Due to his short
smooth coat, his well developed muscles are clearly visible
especially when he moves.

### IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS:


•
In relation of length to height, his build should be as square as
possible.


FCI-St. N° 184 / 18.04.2007
•
The length of the head (measured from the tip of the nose to the
occiput) corresponds to half the length of the topline (measured
from the withers to the set on of the tail).

BEHAVIOUR/TEMPERAMENT: His lively, spirited, self assured
and evenly tempered nature combined with intelligence and
endurance makes him an agreeable family, watch and companion
dog.

### HEAD



### CRANIAL REGION



Skull: Strong, elongated, without markedly protruding occiput. The
forehead is flat and runs parallel to the bridge of nose.
Stop: Slight, yet clearly defined.

### FACIAL REGION


Nose: Nose leather well developed and always black.
Muzzle: Ending in a blunt wedge. Bridge of nose straight.
Lips: Black, smooth and tight-fitting to the jaws; corners of mouth
closed.
Jaws/Teeth: Strong upper and lower jaw.  The complete scissor bite
(42 pure white teeth according to the dentition formula) is strong and
firmly closing. The chewing muscles are strongly developed without
pronounced cheeks interfering with the smooth outline

EYES: Dark, oval, with black pigmented, close fitting eyelids.

EARS: Drop ears, set high, V-shaped,with  inner edges  lying close
to the cheeks, turned forward towards temples. Folds parallel, should
not be above the top of the skull.

NECK:  Nobly curved, not too short. Blending smoothly into the
withers without any marked set on. Dry,without dewlap or
throatiness.  Throat skin  tight-fitting without folds.

FCI-St. N° 184 / 18.04.2007

Loins: Short, strong, and deep. The distance from last rib to hip is
short to make the dog appear compact.

straight, and not close together; seen from the side, the forearms are
straight.

well muscled on both sides of the shoulder bone, protruding over the
points of the thoracic vertebrae. As sloping as possible and well laid
back. forming an angle of appr. 50° to the horizontal.

eyes, at the underside of the throat, on the pastern, on the feet, at
the inside of the hind legs and under the root of the tail. Two
