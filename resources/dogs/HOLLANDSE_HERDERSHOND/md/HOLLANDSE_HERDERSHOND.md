BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: Originally the main function of
the Dutch Shepherd Dog was that of a shepherd’s dog in the
countryside. From early times, the Dutch had an arable culture that was
– among other things – maintained by flocks of sheep. The dogs had to
keep the flock away from the crops, which they did by patrolling the
borders of the road and the fields. They also accompanied the flocks on
their way to the common meadows, markets and ports.
At the farm, they kept the hens away from the kitchen garden, they
herded the cows together for milking and pulled the milk carts. They
also alerted the farmers if strangers entered the farmyard. Around 1900,
sheep flocks had for the greater part disappeared in the Netherlands.
The versatile skills of the Dutch Shepherd Dog made him suitable for
dog training, which was then starting to become popular. Thus he
started on a new career as a police dog, as a search- and tracking dog
and as a guide dog for the blind. He is, however, still capable of herding
sheep. The breed’s first standard dates from 12 June 1898.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: A medium-sized, middle-weighted,
well-muscled dog of powerful and well-balanced structure. A dog with
lots of endurance, a lively temperament and an intelligent expression.
Depending on the coat the breed is distinguished in the following
varieties: short-, long- and wire haired.




St-FCI n°223/ xx.xx.2020
IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS: The length of the body (from point
of shoulder to point of buttock) exceeds the height at the withers,
approximately at a ratio of 10:9, as suits a trotting dog.
The proportion of the length of the skull to the muzzle is 1:1.

BEHAVIOUR/TEMPERAMENT: Very loyal and reliable, always
alert, watchful, active, independent, with persistence, intelligence,
prepared to be obedient and gifted with the true shepherding
temperament. The Dutch Shepherd Dog works willingly together with
its owner and he deals independently with any task which is assigned to
him.
When herding larger flocks he must have the capacity to work together
with several other dogs

HEAD: In good proportion to the body. Seen from above and in profile
it is wedge-shaped. Its shape is rather elongated , without wrinkles; dry,
with flat cheeks and no pronounced cheekbones. Because of the coat,
the head of the wire-haired variety appears to look more square, but this
is an illusion.

### CRANIAL REGION:


Skull: Flat
Stop: Slight, though clearly present.

### FACIAL REGION:


Muzzle: Slightly longer than the flat forehead. Bridge of the muzzle
straight and parallel to the top line of the cranial region.
Nose: Black.
Lips: Tight and well pigmented.
Jaws/Teeth: Scissors bite, strong, regular and complete.

EYES: Dark coloured and medium sized. The eyes are almond shaped
and slightly oblique. The eyes should not be set too wide and should
not protrude.

EARS: Medium sized. When the dog is alert, the ears are carried high
and erect.




St-FCI n°223/ xx.xx.2020

NECK: Not too short, dry, without folds and gradually flowing into the
body.

BODY: Firm, but not coarse.
Top line: There is a smooth, gentle transition from the neck to the top
line of the body, in which head and neck are carried in a natural pose.
Back: Straight and firm.
Loin: Firm, neither long nor narrow.
Croup: Slightly sloping, not short.
Underline and belly: Slight tuck up.
Chest: Deep and long enough, not narrow, ribs slightly sprung.
Fore chest: Fairly well developed.

### TAIL:


At rest, hanging straight down or with a slight curve. Reaches to the
hock. In action, carried gracefully upwards, never curled or carried
sideways.

### LIMBS:



### FOREQUARTERS:


The forelegs are powerful, of good length, well muscled. The bone is
solid but not heavy. Always generally showing a straight line, but with
sufficient suppleness of pastern.
Shoulder: Shoulder-blades well joined to the body and well sloping.
Upper arm: Approximately equal length to the shoulder-blades and well
angulated with the connecting bones.
Elbow: Well attached.
Forefeet: Oval. Well knit, toes arched. Black nails and elastic dark
pads.

HINDQUARTERS:  The hind-legs are powerful and well-muscled. The
bone is solid but never heavy. Not excessively angulated.
Thigh and lower thigh: Of approximately equal length.
Hock: Perpendicular below the point of buttock.
Dewclaws: None present




St-FCI n°223/ xx.xx.2020
Hind feet: Oval. Well knit, toes arched. Black nails and elastic dark
pads.

GAIT/MOVEMENT: The Dutch Shepherd Dog is a trotter with free,
smooth and supple movement, without exaggerated drive or stride.

### COAT


Hair:
Short hair: All over the body, quite hard, close-fitting, not too short coat
with woolly undercoat. Ruff, breeches and tail plume are clearly
visible.
Long hair: All over the body, long, straight, well fitting, harsh to the
touch, without curls or waves and with a woolly undercoat. Distinct ruff
and breeches.
Tail abundantly coated. Head, ears and feet and also the hind legs
below the hocks are short and densely coated. The backsides of the
forelegs show a strongly developed coat, shortening in length towards
the feet, the so-called feathering. No fringes at the ears.
Wire hair: Dense, harsh tousled coat and a woolly, dense undercoat all
over the body except for the head. The coat should be close.
Upper- and lower lip should be well-covered with hair, the whiskers
and beard, and two well defined, coarse rough eyebrows that are
distinct but not exaggerated.
Furnishings are not soft. The hair on the skull and on the cheeks is less
strongly developed. In profile it seems as if the head has a more square
appearance. Strongly developed breeches are desirable. Tail is covered
all round with hair. The brindle colour may be less pronounced because
of the tousled coat.
The wire hair coat should be hand-plucked on average twice a year.

Colour:
Brindle. The basic colour is golden or silver. Golden can vary from
light sand- coloured to chestnut red. The brindle is clearly present all
over the body, in the ruff, breeches and tail. Too much black is
undesirable. A black mask is preferable.
Heavy white markings on chest or feet is not desirable.

### SIZE AND WEIGHT:


Height at the withers:  Males:     57 - 62 cm.



Females: 55- 60 cm.

FAULTS: Any departure from the foregoing points should be
considered a fault and the seriousness with which the fault should be
regarded should be in exact proportion to its degree and its effect on the
functional health and welfare of the dog.

### DISQUALIFYING FAULTS:


• Aggressive or overly shy.
• Any dog clearly showing physical or behavioural abnormalities.
• Lack of breed-type.


### N.B:


• Male animals should have two apparently normal testicles fully
descended into the scrotum.
• Only functionally and clinically healthy dogs, with breed typical
conformation, should be used for breeding.
