Scenthounds and
related breeds.
Section 1:3
Small-sized Hounds.
With working trial.

BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: The small-sized German
hound, the Westphalian Dachsbracke, was imported to Sweden in


## 1910. The first dogs were registered in 1913 but little is known about


the breed before 1930. It was from then on it gained reputation as a
very good tracker of deer. Deer had been sparse until then, but as they
grew stronger in numbers and spread further north, hunters got to hear
about the advantages of the short-legged deer tracking hound. In 1947,
the larger (2 cm higher at the withers) Swedish variety of the Bracke
was given the name Drever.  In 1953 the Drever was recognised as a
Swedish breed. The Drever is considered the first choice for roe and
deer hunting but it is also a very reliable hound for hunting both hare
and fox. In all essentials, the Drever should be built as a track hound.
It should have the ability to work efficiently in the Swedish terrain and
climate. The breed is strictly kept as a hunting dog and is hardly ever
heard of as "just" a companion dog.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: Rather long in body and fairly short on
legs. Appearance should be robust and strong rather than elegant and
speedy. Proud carriage, well developed muscles and agile appearance.
Differences in built between male and female clearly defined.

IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS: The distance between ground and
sternum should be 40% of the height at the withers. The muzzle should
equal the skull in length.
