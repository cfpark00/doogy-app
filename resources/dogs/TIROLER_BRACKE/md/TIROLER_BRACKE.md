BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: The Tyrolean Hound (Tiroler
Bracke) originates, as do all types of Bracke, from the Keltenbracke
(Celtic Hound).  With its dense doublecoat it represents the purest
type of game hunting hounds.  Already around 1500 Emperor
Maximilian 1st used first this noble Bracke in Tyrol and for hunting
and mentioned in his hunt diaries that he took his lead hounds
(limiers) from them.  In 1860, pure breeding from certain strains
began in Tyrol and in 1896 a standard was drawn up which was
officially recognized in 1908.  From the many types of Bracke native
to the Tyrol, only the red and the black and tan colour varieties
remain.  In 1994, the short-legged variety of the Tyrolean Hound was
delated.
