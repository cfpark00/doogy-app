Section 1 Bichons and related breeds.

BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: The origin of the Bolognese
is confused with that of the Maltese, because their distant ancestors
are the same little dogs mentioned in Latin by Aristotle (384–322
B.C.) under the denomination of canes melitenses. Bolognese,
already known in the Roman era appears most especially among the
very appreciated gifts, which were made during a whole era by the
people of power of that world. Cosimo de Medici (1389–1464)
brought no less than eight to Brussels as gifts to as many Belgian
noblemen. Philipe II, king of Spain 1556–1598, after having received
two as a gift from the Duke d’Este, thanked him in writing saying, ”
These little dogs are the most royal gifts one can give to an
emperor”. Bolognese are represented in paintings by Titian, Pierre
Breughel called le Vieux and Goya.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: Small size, stocky and compact,
covered with a pure white coat, long and fluffy.

IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS: Square built, the length of the
body being equal to the height at the withers. Length of head
reaching 1/3 of the height at the withers. Depth of chest almost half
of the height at the withers.




FCI-St. N° 196  / 17.12.2015
BEHAVIOUR / TEMPERAMENT: Very serene, generally not
very active. Eventful but calm very faithful to his master and his
entourage.

HEAD: Medium long. The width measured at the level of the
zygomatic arches is the same as the length.

### CRANIAL REGION:


Skull: Slightly ovoid in shape (egg-shaped) in the sagittal direction
and has rather convex sides; rather flat in its upper part. The
protuberances of the frontal bones are well developed. The
longitudinal axes of the skull and muzzle are parallel; the frontal
furrow is only slightly accentuated, as is also the occipital
protuberance. The length of the skull is slightly more than that of the
muzzle.
Stop: Rather accentuated.

### FACIAL REGION:


Nose: Set on the same line as the topline of the muzzle: seen in
profile the front is vertical. Large and must be black.
Muzzle: Its length is equal to 2/5 of the length of the head; the
topline of the muzzle is straight and the sides of the muzzle are
parallel, so that the forepart of the muzzle is almost square. The
lower orbital region is well chiselled.
Lips: Upper lips being only slightly developed in depth, they do not
cover the bottom lips, and the lower profile of the muzzle is
determined by the lower jaw.
Jaws/Teeth: Jaws normally developed, with top and bottom arches
perfectly adapted. Teeth white evenly aligned, with strong and
complete dentition. Articulation of incisors as scissor bite; pincer bite
tolerated.

EYES: Set on an almost frontal plane; size slightly superior to
normal. Eyelid opening is round; the eyeball must not be prominent;
the white of the eye is not visible. The rims of the eyelids must be
black, and the iris of a dark ochre colour.




FCI-St. N° 196  / 17.12.2015

EARS: High set, they are long and hanging, but rather rigid at their
base, so that the upper part of the external ear is detached from the
skull, giving thus the impression of the head being larger than it
really is.

NECK: Without dewlap: its length is equal to the length of the head.

BODY: The dog being of a square construction, the length of the
body, measured from the point of the shoulder to the point of the
buttock bone is equal to that of the height at the withers.
Top line: The straight profile of the back, and that of the loin,
slightly convex, merge harmoniously in the line of the croup.
Withers: Only slightly prominent above the top line. Top of shoulder
blades well spaced.
Back: Straight.
Loin:  Short, strong, slightly convex.
Croup: Very broad and only slightly sloping.
Chest: Ample, let down to level of elbows, with well-sprung ribs, the
height reaching almost half of the height at the withers. The point of
the sternum is only slightly prominent.
Underline and belly: Following the profile of the sternum, then rises
slightly towards the belly.

TAIL: Set in the line of the croup, carried curved over the back.

### LIMBS



### FOREQUARTERS:


General appearance: Forearms are perfectly straight and parallel in
relation to the median plane of the body.
Shoulder: The length of the shoulder blades is equal to 1/4 of the
height of the withers; in relation to the horizontal, they are slanting
and are near the vertical in relation to the median plane of the body.
Upper arm: Well joined to the body, of an almost equal length to that
of the shoulder, but less slanting.
Elbows: They are on a parallel plane to the median plane of the body.


FCI-St. N° 196  / 17.12.2015

Forearm: The length is equal to that of the upper arm; follows a
perfect vertical direction.
Metacarpus (Pastern): Seen from the front they continue the vertical
line of the forearm. Seen in profile the pastern is slightly slanting.
Forefeet: Oval shaped, with well cushioned dark pads and very hard
black nails.

### HINDQUARTERS:


General appearance: Viewed from behind, the hind legs must follow
from the point of the buttock bone to the ground in a perfectly
vertical line - legs are parallel to each other.
Thigh: Length is equal to 1/3 of the height at the withers. Slanting
from top to bottom and back to front and perfectly parallel to the
median plane of the body.
Stifle (Knee): Firm, not very angled.
Lower thigh: Longer than the thigh.
Hock joint: The tibio-tarsal angle is not very closed.
Metatarsus (Rear pastern): The distance from the point of the hock to
the ground is slightly less than a third of the height at the withers.
Hind feet: Same characteristics as the forefeet, but less oval.

GAIT / MOVEMENT: Free, energetic, with a noble and
distinguished head carriage.

SKIN: Taut and tightly fitted to the body all over, the third eyelids
strictly pigmented black.

### COAT


Hair: Long all over the body, from head to tail, from the top line to
the feet. It is shorter on the muzzle. Forms long flocks that have the
same texture all over the body, rather off-standing coat thus not
falling flat and tight, never shows fringes.

Colour: Pure white, very slight shades of ivory are not disqualifying.
