BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: The Norrbottenspitz (Spitz
from the county of North Bothnia) probably originates from
small Laika type spitz that were known to live with hunting
people in the North Cape area already in prehistoric time. Small
hunting spitz have survived for thousands of years through
natural selection - the survival of the fittest. In the very harsh
areas of the northern parts of the Scandinavian Peninsula,
hunting for food and fur was a necessity for survival. Precious
furs like sable, marten-skin and ermine were the only valid
currency for centuries. When fur prices dropped drastically
after World War II, so did the interest for the Norrbottenspitz.
The breed vanished and had no registrations for many years;
hence the Swedish Kennel Club (SKK) declared it extinct. But
only a decade later news came that some true to type specimens
had been found living as pets and watch dogs on small
homesteads in the inland North Bothnia. Due to the very
dedicated work of a few men,  this old type hunting spitz was
saved. In 1967 the Norrbottenspitz was re-introduced to the
Registry and a new standard was drawn up.
