BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: Central Asia Shepherd Dog
(CASD) is one of the most ancient breed of dogs. They were formed
as a breed from natural selection during more than four thousand
years in the vast territory, which spreads nowadays from the
Caspian Sea to China and from Southern Ural to Afghanistan.  Its
heritage is from the most ancient dogs of Tibet, Cattle Dogs from
various nomad tribes’ dogs that are closely related to the Mongolian
Shepherd Dog and the Tibetan Mastiff. The CASD were mainly
used to protect cattle, caravans and the owner’s dwellings, and being
exposed to rigid natural selection. Hard living conditions and
constant struggle against predators have had influence on the shape
as well as the dog’s character and it has made it strong, fearless, and
taught it to save its energy. In the places of primordial habitation,
the CASD were used mainly to protect herds from predators and
also as guard dogs.
The work with the breed started in the USSR in the 1930s.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: The Central Asian Shepherd Dog is
of harmonious build and large stature, moderately long (neither long
nor short in body).


FCI-St. N° 335 / 09.02.2011
Robust, muscular body, voluminous, but not with visible muscles.
Sexual dimorphism is clearly defined. The males are more massive
and courageous than females with more pronounced withers and a
larger head. Full maturity is reached by the age of 3 years.

IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS: The length of body only slightly
exceeds the height at withers. Larger stature is desirable but
proportional constitution must remain. Length of forelegs up to the
elbow is 50-52 % of the height at the withers. The length of muzzle
is less than 1/2 the length of head, but more than a 1/3.

BEHAVIOUR AND TEMPERAMENT: Self assured, balanced
quiet, proud and independent. The dogs are very courageous and
have high working capacity, endurance and a natural instinct of
territory. Fearlessness towards large predators is a characteristic
feature.

HEAD: Massive and in balance with general appearance. Head
shape is close to rectangular, seen from above and side.

CRANIAL REGION: Deep in skull. The forehead is flat and the
skull part is flat and long. Occiput is well defined but hardly visible,
because of well developed muscles. Supraorbital ridges are
moderately defined.
Stop: Stop is moderately defined.

### FACIAL REGION:


Nose: Large, well developed but not exceeding the general contour
of the muzzle.   Colour of the nose is black but in white and fawn
coloured dogs the nose can be lighter.
Muzzle: The muzzle is blunt and of moderate length, it is almost
rectangular viewed from above and sides and narrowing very
slightly towards the nose. Muzzle is voluminous, deep and well
filled under the eyes.
Bridge of muzzle is broad, straight and sometimes with a slight
down face. Chin is well developed.
Lips: Thick, upper lips tightly covering the lower lips when the
mouth is closed. Full black pigmentation is preferable.


FCI-St. N° 335 / 09.02.2011
Jaws / Teeth: The jaws are strong and broad. Teeth are large, white
and close to each other, 42 in total. Incisors are set on a line. Scissors
bite, pincer bite and also reversed scissors bite is accepted. Canines
are set well apart. An injury to the teeth that does not affect the use
of the bite is of no consequence.
Cheeks: The Cheekbones are long and well developed, without
interfering with the rectangular shape of head.

EYES: Medium sized, with oval form, set well apart, looking
straight ahead, and moderately deep set. The colour of the eyes from
dark brown to hazel. The darker colour is preferable. The eyelids are
thick and preferably with lower eye lid not too loose.  No visible
third eyelid. Fully pigmented eyes rims are preferred. Whatever the
colour of coat, eye rims should be black. Expression is confident and
dignified.

EARS: Medium sized, triangular shape, thick, low set and hanging.
Lower part of ear base is level with, or slightly below the eyes.
Traditional ear-cropping, in the fashion illustrated on the cover, is
still practiced in country of origin and in countries where it is not
prohibited by law.

NECK: The neck is of medium length, very powerful, oval at crosssection, well muscled, and low set. Dewlap is a specific breed
feature.

### BODY:


Top line: Well proportioned and well sustained, and must keep
typical topline in stance.
Withers: Well defined, especially in males, muscular, long and high,
with well defined transition to the back.
Back: Straight, broad, well muscled, the actual length is about ½ of
the length from the withers to tail set.
Loin: Short, broad, muscled, slightly arched.

Croup: Moderately long, broad, well muscled, slightly sloping to tail
set. The height at the withers exceeds the height over rump by 1-2
cm.


FCI-St. N° 335 / 09.02.2011
Chest: Deep, long, broad, distinctly developed, ribcage broadening
towards the back. False ribs are long. Lower part of the chest is level
with the elbow or slightly below. Fore chest extends slightly in front
of the humerus/scapula joint.
Underline and belly: Belly is moderately tucked up.

TAIL: Thick at the base and set fairly high. The natural tail is
carried in a sickle curve or curled in a loose ring that begins at the
last third of the tail. When alert the tail rises to the line of back or
slightly above. Hanging at rest. Traditional tail docking, in the
fashion illustrated on the cover, is still practiced in country of origin
and in countries where it is not prohibited by law.
Natural tail is of equal value to a docked tail.
