### CANADIAN ESKIMO DOG




FCI-St. N° 211 / 07.11.2018
ORIGIN: Canada.

### DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THE OFFICIAL VALID



### STANDARD: 28.02.2018.



UTILIZATION: For centuries this breed was used as a draught
animal and was capable of pulling between 45 and 80 kg. per dog,
covering distances from 15 to 70 miles per day. He was also used as
a hunting dog, to locate seal breathing holes for the  Inuit hunters. As
a hunting dog he would also attack and hold at bay musk ox and
polar bear for the Inuit hunters. In the summer the dog was used as a
pack dog carrying up to 15 kg.


FCI-CLASSIFICATION: Group 5
Spitz and primitive



types.

Section 1
Nordic
Sledge
Dogs.

Without working trial.



BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: The breed has an 1100 to
2000 year history of being interdependent with the Thule culture of
Inuit (Eskimo people) who, following the Dorset culture, occupied
the coastal and archipelago area of what is now Arctic Canada.
Although within the spitz family of dogs, the Canadian Eskimo
Dog’s origin prior to this is lost in the Inuit prehistory which
includes the migration of the Mongolian race from the Asian
continent to North America. The existing strain of Canadian Eskimo
Dog originated from stock primarily bred by the Eskimo Dog
Research Foundation in the Northwest Territories. The foundation’s
work over a six-year period was primarily funded by the
Governments of Canada and the Northwest Territories and involved
the purchase of specimens from the remnant population of dogs kept
by the Inuit of the Boothia Peninsula, Melville Peninsula and parts of
Baffin Island.




FCI-St. N° 211 / 07.11.2018
The Canadian Eskimo Dog, as a primitive dog, is primarily a
carnivorous breed, whose natural diet consisted of seal, walrus, fish,
or caribou.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: The Canadian Eskimo Dog is a
powerfully built, moderately sized dog with a thick neck and chest
and medium length legs. Typical of the spitz family of dogs he has a
wedge-shaped head held high with thick erect ears. The eyes are
obliquely set giving a serious appearance. The dog has a bushy tail
carried up or curled over the back. Of almost equal height at the hips
as at the withers, medium to large boned and well muscled the dog
displays a majestic and powerful physique giving the impression that
he is not built for speed but rather for hard work. Above all the body
should be muscled and not fat. Females will have a smaller and less
muscled body than the males. During the winter the body is thickly
clothed with an outer coat of straight or erect hair; below is dense
underfur which enables the animal to easily withstand the rigours of
high latitudes. A mane-like growth of longer hair over the neck and
shoulder will appear on male specimens. The whole conformation of
the Canadian Eskimo Dog should be one of strength, power and
endurance balanced with agility, alertness and boldness. The female
of the breed will usually have a shorter coat than the male and will
always be significantly smaller than the male. As young bitches, they
will be finer boned giving among other things a narrower head which
tends to produce a friendlier looking face than with males. Both
males and females of the breed are known to have a rapid growth
rate reaching working size around seven months. However, the
maturing process extends to at least three years of age giving them a
very majestic appearance. Puppies have often been described as
miniature adults, with erect ears and a curly tail at the young ages
between three to five weeks. There may be occasional periods during
adolescent growth stages when the ears may not be fully erect but it
is important to note that the ears of the Canadian Eskimo Dog do not
have the same gradual growth of becoming erect around four months
of age as is seen in some other breeds.



FCI-St. N° 211 / 07.11.2018
IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS: Width of the forehead between
the ears on the males will be from 5-6 inches (13-15 cm). On the
females the distance will be from 4-1/2 - 5-1/2 inches (11-14 cm).

### BEHAVIOUR/TEMPERAMENT:


The
temperament
of
the
Canadian Eskimo Dog should reflect the tough, hard-working breed
that he is. He is not to be viewed as a domestic pet but rather as a
primitive dog originally domesticated by Inuit for specific tasks in a
harsh arctic environment. In general disposition, the mature
Canadian Eskimo Dog is gentle and affectionate with the average
individual, enjoying attention. Even with total strangers the dogs are
rarely standoffish. Usually they will exhibit a rather quiet
friendliness and harmless curiosity or become completely distant.
The dog is very pack oriented and if raised as a group, dominant and
subordinate roles will be acted out under the leadership of a totally
dominant or boss dog. Behaviour within a group or pack is usually
well structured and controlled but it is not uncommon to see battle
scars or torn ears on dogs originating from kennel areas where the
dogs are raised in groups or packs. Compared to modern domestic
breeds, the Canadian Eskimo Dog has an almost over response to
any stimulus whether it be food, work, defense or play. For this
reason, the dog should be a companion for adults and is not to be
considered a child’s pet.

### HEAD



### CRANIAL REGION:


Skull: Massive but well-proportioned being broad and wedgeshaped. Although often described as wolf-like in appearance the
head of the Canadian Eskimo Dog has a more elevated forehead.
Immature females will have a much narrower skull than the male.

### FACIAL REGION:


Nose: Pigmentation of the nose will vary from black to light brown
(especially on lighter coloured dogs with red, buff, or cinnamon on
the body). Butterfly noses have, on occasion appeared with the light
brown nose.




FCI-St. N° 211 / 07.11.2018

Muzzle: Tapered and of medium length.
Lips: Black or brown with pink.
Jaws/Teeth: The jaws are heavy and powerful possessing large teeth
with well-developed canine teeth. The incisors meet in a scissor bite.

EYES: Generally dark-coloured but hazel or yellow-coloured eyes
will appear in the breed. They are small, wide spaced and placed
obliquely in the head which tends to impart much more of a wild and
deceitful appearance than the dog deserves.

EARS: Short, thick and have slightly rounded ends. They are carried
erect, turned forwards and are covered with dense short hair.

NECK: Short, straight, thick, and very muscular.

BODY: Of almost equal height at the hips as at the withers.
Back: The spinal column when felt through the furred body is well
pronounced.
Loin: Well-developed.
Chest: Deep, wide and well-muscled.
Underline and belly: There is very little curve to the flank.

TAIL: Large and bushy and generally carried up or curled over the
back. Mature bitches may on occasion carry their tails down.

### LIMBS



### FOREQUARTERS:


Shoulder: Broad, obliquely set with moderate muscling.
Forearm: Straight but may give the appearance of being bowed,
because of the well-developed triceps muscle above and behind the
elbow and the pronounced muscle on the forearm itself.
Forefeet: Large, nearly round, well arched with thick pads being well
furred between; however, under extremely cold winter conditions,
this fur will grow to be very long so as to cover the bottom of the
pads.




FCI-St. N° 211 / 07.11.2018


### HINDQUARTERS:


General appearance: The hips may appear as pronounced and bony
as the spine, and are about the same height as the withers.
Thigh: The legs will be very muscular with the width of the thigh
being carried well down towards the hock.
Stifle (Knee): Well bent.
Hind feet: Similar in design to the front but slightly longer. From the
rear, the legs will appear straight with the hocks turning neither in
nor out.

GAIT / MOVEMENT: The working gait of this dog is a powerful
and brisk trot with the rear legs moving in line with the front legs in
the force motion but showing some abduction during the forward
movement of the stride. This may be especially pronounced in
mature male dogs with many miles in harness. This gait may appear
awkward to the untrained eye but is a result of a wide stance caused
by well-developed thighs. This particular gait is a well-balanced
efficient stride for heavy pulling day after day. The movement of the
dog should in no way appear as a choppy or paddling motion. The
females are much faster and freer in movement than the heavier
males and are capable of breaking stride from the natural trot and
running or galloping for much longer distances than the males.

SKIN: Should feel thick and tough.

### COAT


Hair: Subject to an annual moult usually in August or September, the
coat is thick and dense with guard hairs being hard and stiff. This
outer coat will vary from 3-6 inches (7-15 cm) in length. In males it
will occur in a mane-like growth over the shoulder and neck making
the male appear much larger in size and taller at the withers than he
actually is. The undercoat is very dense to give excellent protection
during the most extreme winter conditions. During the moult this
underfur will come loose in clumps over a period of a few days.
Females will usually have a shorter coat overall partially because of
the additional moult that will occur following the birth of pups.


FCI-St. N° 211 / 07.11.2018



Colour: No one colour or colour pattern should dominate the breed
with the colour and colour patterns of the Canadian Eskimo Dog
ranging from:
(a) An all white body with pigmentation around the eyes, nose and
lips (e.g. not albino).
(b) White body with only the smallest amount of red, buff
(including
cinnamon shades), grey or black around the ears or eyes.
(c) White bodies with either red, buff, cinnamon, grey, or black
head marks around ears and eyes or the entire head and the
occasional small patch of the same colour on the body usually
around the hip or flank.
(d) Red and white, or buff and white, or cinnamon and white or
black and white with about 50/50 distribution of the two
colours, on various parts of the body.
(e) Red body or buff body or cinnamon body with white on chest
and/or legs and underside of body.
(f) Sable or black body or dark grey body with white on chest
and/or legs and underside of body occasionally extending
around part of the neck in a collar-like fashion.
(g) Silver grey or greyish white body.
(h) Buff to brown undercoat with black guard hairs.
Very common to dogs with solid colour to most of the head is a
mask-like shading of white around the eyes and/or muzzle with or
without white spots over the eyes. On very rare occasions the spots
over the eyes as well as cheek-marks will be buff coloured thus
adding a third colour to a normally two-coloured animal.

### SIZE AND WEIGHT:



Height at the withers:   Males: 58-70 cm
Females: 50-60 cm
Weight:

Males: 30-40 kg
Females: 18-30 kg




FCI-St. N° 211 / 07.11.2018



FAULTS: Any departure from the foregoing points should be
considered a fault and the seriousness with which the fault should be
regarded should be in exact proportion to its degree and its effect
upon the health and welfare of the dog (and its ability to perform its
traditional work).

### SEVERE FAULTS:


•
Head: Square muzzle or loose lips, round or bulging eyes.
•
Neck: Long and thin.
•
Body: Narrow chest, over-all lack of muscle, excess fat, sloping
back, coarseness or lack of finer bones in bitches.
•
Legs: thin, fine boned or cow hocked.
•
Feet: Flat or open.
•
Coat: Short, off prime.

### DISQUALIFYING FAULTS:


• Aggressive or overly shy dogs.
• Any dog clearly showing physical or behavioural abnormalities.
• Blue eyes.
• Floppy ears, the exception being battle torn ears.
• Clipping or altering the coat by scissoring.
• No evidence at all of a curled or upright tail in male dogs
(recognizing that a tail may occasionally be kept down as a sign
of subordination or stress).
• Excessive undershot or overshot jaw.

### N.B.:


• Male animals should have two apparently normal testicles fully

descended into the scrotum.
• Only functionally and clinically healthy dogs, with breed typical

conformation, should be used for breeding.
