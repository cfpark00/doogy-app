Section 1.3 Small-sized Hounds.

With working trial.

BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: The Beagle, said to have
been bred down from the larger Foxhound to hunt with men on
foot, preferably after the hare. He is still used in packs, very often
organised by institutions, including colleges and schools. A
bustling, eager little dog, full of enthusiasm and vigour, ever ready
for any activity which involves him. Everything about the breed
gives the impression of athleticism and there is no better sight than
a Beagle pack in full pursuit, their heads down to the scent, their
sterns up in rigid order as they concentrate on the chase.
During the reigns of King Henry VIII and Queen Elizabeth I there
were wirehaired Beagles, some of which were small enough to be
carried in the pocket of a hunting jacket. Size has increased over
the years but smaller versions of the breed, called ‘pocket Beagles’,
are sometimes born.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: A sturdy, compactly-built hound,
conveying the impression of quality without coarseness.

IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS: Length of head, between occiput
and tip of nose, divided by stop, as equally as possible. Height to

BEHAVIOUR AND TEMPERAMENT: A merry hound whose
essential function is to hunt, primarily hare, by following a scent.
Bold, with great activity, stamina and determination.
