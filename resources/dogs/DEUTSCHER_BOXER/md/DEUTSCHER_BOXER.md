mastiff type.

With working trial.

BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: The small, so called Brabant
Bullenbeisser is regarded as the immediate ancestor of the Boxer.  In
the past, the breeding of these Bullenbeissers was in the hands of the
huntsmen, whom they assisted during the hunt.  Their task was to
seize the game put up by the hounds and hold it firmly until the
huntsman arrived and put an end to the prey.  For this job the dog
had to have jaws as wide as possible with widely spaced teeth, in
order to bite firmly and hold on tightly.  A Bullenbeisser which had
these characteristics was best suited to this job and was used for
breeding.  Previously, only the ability to work and utilization were
considered.  Selective breeding was carried out which produced a
dog with a wide muzzle and an upturned nose.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: The Boxer is a medium sized, smooth
coated, sturdy dog of compact, square build and strong bone.  His
muscles are taut, strongly developed and moulded in appearance.
His movement is lively, powerful with noble bearing.  The Boxer
must be neither cumbersome nor heavy, nor light or lacking in body
substance.


FCI-St. N° 144 / 09.07.2008

### IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS:


a) Length of body / Height at withers: Square build, which means
that the horizontal line of the back is perpendicular to the vertical
line passing through the point of shoulder and to the other vertical
line passing through the point of buttock, thus defining a square
outline.
b) Depth of brisket / Height at withers: The chest reaches to the
elbows. Depth of chest is half the height at withers.
c) Length of nose bridge / Length of head: Length of nose bridge in
relation to skull should be 1:2 (measured respectively from tip of
nose to inner corner of eye and from inner corner of eye to occiput).

BEHAVIOUR / TEMPERAMENT: The Boxer should be fearless
self-confident, calm and equable.  Temperament is of the utmost
importance and requires careful attention.  Devotion and loyalty
towards his master and his entire household, his watchfulness and
self-assured courage as a defender are famous.  He is harmless with
his family but distrustful of strangers.  Happy and friendly in play,
yet fearless in a serious situation.  Easy to train on account of his
willingness to obey, his pluck and courage, natural keenness, and
scent capability.  Undemanding and clean, he is just as agreeable and
appreciated in the family circle as he is as a guard, companion and
working dog.  His character is trustworthy, with no guile or cunning,
even in old age.

HEAD: This gives the Boxer his characteristic look.  Must be in
good proportion to the body and appear neither too light nor too
heavy.  Muzzle should be as broad and powerful as possible.  The
harmony of the head depends on the balance between muzzle and
skull.
From whichever direction the head is viewed, from front, above or
sideways, the muzzle must always be in the right proportion to the
skull i.e. it must never appear too small.  It should be clean, not
showing any wrinkle.  However, natural folds are formed in the
cranial region when alerted.  From root of nose, folds are always
indicated running in a downward direction on both sides.


FCI-St. N° 144 / 09.07.2008
The dark mask is confined to the muzzle and must be in sharp
contrast to the colour of the head so that the face does not appear
sombre.

### CRANIAL REGION:


Skull: The cranial region should be as lean and angular as possible.
It is slightly arched, neither too round and short, nor flat; nor should
it be too broad.  Occiput not too pronounced.  Furrow in forehead
only slightly marked, must not be too deep, especially between the
eyes.
Stop: The forehead forms a distinct stop with the bridge of nose.
Bridge of nose must not be forced back into the forehead as in the
Bulldog, nor should it be downfaced.

### FACIAL REGION:


Nose: Nose is broad and black and only slightly turned up with wide
nostrils.  Tip of nose is placed slightly higher than root of nose.
Muzzle: The muzzle is powerfully developed in three-dimensional
volume, neither pointed nor narrow, nor short or shallow.  Its
appearance is influenced by:
a) Shape of jaw. b) Position of canine teeth. c) Shape of lips.  The
canines must be placed as far apart as possible and must be of good
length, making the front of the muzzle broad, almost square and
forming a blunt angle with bridge of nose.
In front, the edge of the upper lip rests on the edge of the lower lip.
The part of the lower jaw with lower lip curved upwards, called the
chin, must not markedly protrude over upper lip, seen from front.
Nor should it be hidden by the upper lip but should be well defined
from front and side.
The canines and incisors of the lower jaw must not be visible when
mouth is closed, neither should the tongue show.  Median groove in
the upper lip (philtrum) is clearly visible.
Lips:  The lips complete the shape of the muzzle.  The upper lip is
thick and padded and fills the space formed by the undershot lower
jaw; it is supported by the lower canines.
Jaws/Teeth: The lower jaw protrudes beyond the upper jaw and is
curved slightly upwards.  The Boxer is undershot.


FCI-St. N° 144 / 09.07.2008
The upper jaw is broad where it joins the cranial region, tapering
only slightly towards the front.  The teeth are strong and healthy.
The incisors are as even as possible, set in a straight line. Canines
wide apart and of good size.
Cheeks: Cheeks are developed in proportion with the strong jaws
without markedly bulging.  They merge with the muzzle in a slight
curve.

EYES: The dark eyes are neither too small nor protruding or deep
set.  Their expression conveys energy and intelligence and must not
be threatening or piercing.  Eye rims must be dark.

EARS: The natural ears are of appropriate size. They are set on wide
apart on highest part of skull.  In repose they lie close to the cheeks
and turn forward with a definite crease, especially when the dog is
alert.

NECK: Topline runs in an elegant arch from the clearly marked
nape to the withers.  It should be of ample length, round, strong and
muscular.

BODY: Square body resting on sturdy, straight legs.
Withers: Should be marked.
Back: Including loin should be short, firm, straight, broad and
muscular.
Croup:  Slightly sloping, broad and only slightly arched.  Pelvis
should be long and broad, especially in bitches.
Chest: Deep, reaching to elbows.  Depth of chest is half the height at
withers. Well-developed forechest. Ribs well sprung but not barrelshaped, extending well to the rear.
Underline: Running towards rear in elegant curve.  Short, taut flanks
slightly tucked up.

TAIL: Set on high rather than low. The tail is of normal length and
left natural.
