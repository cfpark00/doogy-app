### GRIFFON NIVERNAIS




FCI-St. N° 17 / 02.04.2004
TRANSLATION: John Miller and Raymond Triquet.  Official
language (FR).

ORIGIN: France.

### DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THE ORIGINAL VALID



### STANDARD: 24.03.2004.



UTILIZATION: Scent hound used mainly for shooting of wild
boar, generally in a pack but also individually.

### FCI-CLASSIFICATION:


Group
Scent hounds and



related breeds.

Section 1.2 Medium-sized hounds.

With working trial.



BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: The Griffon Nivernais may
have descended from Gallic hounds (Canis Segusius) used by the
Gauls, and from the grey Saint Louis dogs.  This breed was much
appreciated for 200 years, up to Louis XI’s reign, then was
abandoned in the royal packs by Francis I who preferred white
hounds.  Nevertheless, certain Nivernais region noblemen conserved
it up to the time of the French Revolution (1789) when the breed
seemed to have disappeared.  A century later, the Griffon Nivernais,
often called “dog of the region”, was recreated from subjects
nevertheless conserved in that cradle of origin of the breed.  At the
end of the XIXe century and the beginning of the XXe, these dogs
received new blood from the Griffon Vendeen, the Fox Hound and
then from the Otterhound, establishing the hound breed unchanged
ever since then.  The club was founded in 1925.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: With a hard and tousled coat
(Barbouillaud in French), very well typed, robust, very hardy and
shaggy.  Dry in limbs and muscles, destined to provide length of
work rather than speed; slightly sad in aspect but in no way nervous.



FCI-St. N° 17 / 02.04.2004
IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS: Body length (point of shoulder to
point of buttocks) is slightly greater than height at shoulder.  Skull
and muzzle are of the same length.

### BEHAVIOUR / TEMPERAMENT:


Behaviour: Very good nose, piercing, and particularly enjoying
difficult terrains and thickets.
Temperament: Excellent at approaching and very good hunter, it’s
courageous when holding firm without being reckless.  Its courage
and initiative allow it to be used successfully in small packs for
hunting wild boar.  Although it can easily be taught hunting that
game, it shows itself occasionally to be obstinate and independent,
and its master should know how to make it obey starting at its
youngest age.

### HEAD



CRANIAL REGION: Very dry, light without being small, somewhat
long without excess.  The lines of the skull and muzzle are parallel.
Skull: Nearly flat, of medium width, sides defined by the only
slightly pronounced zygomatic arches.  Occipital peak only
perceptible when touched.
Stop: Only slightly marked, appearing however increasingly
accentuated when the coat springs up more, but without
exaggeration.

### FACIAL REGION:


Nose: Black, quite visible.
Muzzle: Same length as the skull, it’s not overly broad at the end
with the sides converging slightly, but not so much as to become
pointed.  A slight beard on the chin.
Lips: Only slightly developed, just covering the lower jaw, hidden by
good moustaches, with good pigmentation.
Jaws/teeth: The jaws of robust aspect, normally developed. A
scissors bite, sometimes a level bite, with the incisors set square to
the jaws.
Complete set of teeth (absence of first premolars (PM1) is not
penalized).


FCI-St. N° 17 / 02.04.2004

EYES: Dark colour preferred.  Gaze lively and penetrating.
Important eyebrow but which doesn’t cover the eye.  The
conjunctiva is not visible.  The eyelids are well pigmented.

EARS : Averagely attached (at little over an inch wide – ca.3 cm) in
line with the upper level of the eye, hanging, supple, rather fine, of
medium width, turned slightly inward at the end, half-long, reaching
the root of the nose.

NECK: Rather light, dry and without dewlap.

### BODY:


Topline: Level, from the withers to the loin.
Withers: Very slightly prominent above the back line and narrowed
due to close shoulder blade summits.
Back: Solid and long enough, rather narrow and sustained, with good
muscles, even if they are only slightly apparent.
Loin: Solid and very slightly arched.
Croup: Bony, a little slanting, with dry muscles.
Chest: Descending as much as possible to the elbow.  Breast only
slightly developed in width.  Long thorax, becoming wider towards
the last ribs.
Ribs: The first are somewhat flat, the last more rounded.
Flank: Full, without excess.
Underline and belly: The underline rises slightly towards the rear
without being whippety.

TAIL: Attached somewhat high, not very long.  It has more coat in
the middle.  When still, it is carried slightly under the horizontal.
When in movement, it is carried upwards sickle-fashion and can
even have the end bent over the back.

### LIMBS



### FOREQUARTERS:




FCI-St. N° 17 / 02.04.2004
General appearance: Good poise.  Generally, and at rest, the forelegs
seen in profile appear a little to the rear of the vertical (under him in
front).
Shoulder: Slightly inclined, dry, well set on the chest.
Elbow: Set well to the body.
Forearm: Appears rather plentiful because of the coat but in reality, it
is drier than thick and quite straight.
Metacarpus (Pastern): Somewhat short and slightly sloping.
Forefeet: Of oval shape, slightly lengthened, with toes solid and tight
together, reminding one of a hare foot, and with nails and pads of
good pigmentation.

### HINDQUARTERS:


General appearance: In profile, slightly under him.  Seen from
behind, the vertical line starting from the point of the buttock should
pass through the point of the hock and equally divide the metatarsus.
Thigh: Rather flat.
Hock: Let down.  Seen in profile, the hock angle is slightly closed.
Metatarsus (Rear pastern): Set a little forward (slightly under him
behind).
Hind feet: Of oval shape, slightly lengthened, with toes solid and
tight together, reminding one of a hare foot, and with nails and pads
of good pigmentation.

GAIT / MOVEMENT: Supple and easy (neither uneven nor
bouncy).

SKIN:  Supple and rather tight, close fitting on all the body, rather
thick, pigmented.  Black spots on the body, lips well pigmented.
Absence of dewlap.

### COAT


Hair: Long, shaggy, and bushy, strong enough and rough (in any case
neither woolly nor curly).  The belly and the inside of the thighs
shouldn’t be hairless.  The well pronounced eyebrows shouldn’t
cover the eye.  A slight beard on the chin and the ear covered enough
in hair.



FCI-St. N° 17 / 02.04.2004
Colour: Always darkened, i.e., the hair always has the ends darker
than the base (black overlay).  Fawn colouring can be more or less
darkened but never orange.
The darkened end can take on a blue aspect.  According to the
amount of darkening of the extremity of the hair, the coat is darker or
lighter.
The presence of white hair scattered in more or less great proportion
in the coat is tolerated and gives rise to shades going from light grey,
including wild boar grey.
The coat is most often marked with tan in the eyebrows, the cheeks,
breast, the ends of the limbs, and under the tail.  That characteristic,
very visible on the pup, often diminishes with age.
The coat is characterised by the basic colour, the spreading of blackoverlaid hair, and possible association with sparse white hair.  One
hence describes for example the “fawn very slightly overlaid with
black” (hare coat), the “sand overlaid with black” (wolf grey), and
the “fawn overlaid with blue” (blue grey).  A white spot is tolerated
on the chest.

### SIZE:


Height at withers: Male:
from 55 to 62 cm.

Female:
from 53 to 60 cm.

With a tolerance of 1 cm more or less.


FAULTS : Any departure from the foregoing points should be
considered a fault and the seriousness with which the fault should be
regarded should be in exact proportion to its degree and its effect
upon the health and welfare of the dog.
•
Behaviour: Timid subject.

### DISQUALIFIYING FAULTS


•
Aggressive or overly shy dogs.
•
Any
dog
clearly showing
physical
or
behavioural
abnormalities.


FCI-St. N° 17 / 02.04.2004
•
Lack of type: Insufficient breed characteristics, which means
the animal on the whole doesn’t resemble other samples of
the breed.

Jaws/teeth: Overshot or undershot.
•
Eyes: Wall-eyed or variegated.
•
Feet: Dewclaws, except in countries where their removal is

Height: Outside the limits defined by the standard.
•
Defects: Noticeable invalidating defect.  Anatomical
malformation.

### N.B.:


•
Male animals should have two apparently normal testicles
fully descended into the scrotum.
•
Only functionally and clinically healthy dogs, with breed

typical conformation should be used for breeding.
