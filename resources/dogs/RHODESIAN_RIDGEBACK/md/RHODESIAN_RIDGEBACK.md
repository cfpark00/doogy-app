BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: The Rhodesian Ridgeback is
presently the only registered breed indigenous to southern Africa. Its
forbears can be traced to the Cape Colony of southern Africa where
they crossed with the early pioneers’ dogs and the semi domesticated,
ridged, Hottentot hunting dogs. Hunting mainly in groups of two or
three, the original function of the Rhodesian Ridgeback, or Lion Dog,
was to track game, especially lion, and with great agility, keep it at
bay until the arrival of the hunter. The original standard, which was
drafted by F.R.Barnes, in Bulawayo, Rhodesia, in 1922, was based on
that of the Dalmatian and was approved by the South African Kennel
Union in 1926.
GENERAL APPEARANCE: The Rhodesian Ridgeback should
represent a well balanced, strong, muscular, agile and active dog,
symmetrical in outline, and capable of great endurance with a fair
amount of speed. The emphasis is on agility, elegance and soundness
with no tendency towards massiveness. The peculiarity of the breed is
the ridge on the back, which is formed by the hair growing in the
opposite direction to the rest of the coat. The ridge is the escutcheon
of the breed. The ridge must be clearly defined, symmetrical and
tapering towards the haunch.


FCI-St. N° 146/ 06.06.2025
It must start immediately behind the shoulders and continue to the hip
(haunches) bones. The ridge must contain only two crowns, identical
and opposite each other. The lower edges of the crowns must not
extend further down the ridge than one third of its length. A good
average width of the ridge is 5cm.

BEHAVIOUR/TEMPERAMENT: Dignified, intelligent, aloof with
strangers, but showing no aggression or shyness.
