### SIBERIAN HUSKY




FCI-St. N° 270 / 18.11.2022

### ORIGIN: U.S.A.



### DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THE OFFICIAL VALID



### STANDARD: 14.11.2022.



UTILIZATION: Sledge dog.

### FCI-CLASSIFICATION:


Group 5
Spitz and primitive types.

Section 1
Nordic Sledge Dogs.

Without working trial.



GENERAL APPEARANCE: The Siberian Husky is a medium-sized
working dog, quick and light on his feet and free and graceful in
action.  His moderately compact and well furred body, erect ears and
brush tail suggest his Northern heritage.  His characteristic gait is
smooth and seemingly effortless.  He performs his original function in
harness most capably, carrying a light load at a moderate speed over
great distances.  His body proportions and form reflect this basic
balance of power, speed and endurance.  The males of the Siberian
Husky breed are masculine but never coarse; the bitches are feminine
but without weakness of structure.  In proper condition, with muscle
firm and well developed, the Siberian Husky does not carry excess
weight.

### IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS:


- In profile, the length of the body from the point of the shoulder to the
rear point of the croup is slightly longer than the height of the body
from the ground to the top of the withers.
- The distance from the tip of the nose to the stop is equal to the
distance from the stop to the occiput.
- Length of the leg from the elbow to ground is slightly more than the
distance from the elbow to the top of withers.

BEHAVIOUR / TEMPERAMENT: The characteristic temperament
of the Siberian Husky is friendly and gentle, but also alert and
outgoing.  He does not display the possessive qualities of the guard


FCI-St. N° 270 / 18.11.2022
dog, nor is he overly suspicious of strangers or aggressive with other
dogs.
Some measure of reserve and dignity may be expected in the mature
dog.  His intelligence, tractability, and eager disposition make him an
agreeable companion and willing worker.

### HEAD



### CRANIAL REGION:


Skull: Of medium size and in proportion to the body; slightly rounded
on top and tapering from the widest point to the eyes.
Stop: Well defined.

### FACIAL REGION:


Nose: Black in black, grey, sable or agouti dogs; liver in red dogs;
black, liver or flesh-coloured in pure white dogs. The lighter-streaked
« snow nose » is equally acceptable.
Muzzle: Of medium length and of medium width, tapering gradually
to the nose, with the tip neither pointed nor square.  The bridge of the
nose is straight from the stop to the tip.
Lips: Well pigmented and close fitting.
Jaws/Teeth: Closing in a scissor bite.

EYES: Almond shaped, moderately spaced and set a trifle obliquely.
Eyes may be brown or blue in colour; one of each or particoloured are
acceptable.
Expression: Keen, but friendly, interested and even mischievous.

EARS: Of medium size, triangular in shape, close fitting and set high
on the head.  They are thick, well furred, slightly arched at the back,
and strongly erect, with slightly rounded tips pointing straight up.

NECK: Medium in length, arched and carried proudly erect when dog
is standing.  When moving at a trot, the neck is extended so that the
head is carried slightly forward.




FCI-St. N° 270 / 18.11.2022


### BODY:


Back: Straight and strong, with a level topline from withers to croup.
Of medium length, neither cobby nor slack from excessive length.
Loin:  Taut and lean, narrower than the rib cage, and with a slight tuckup.
Croup: Slopes away from the spine at an angle, but never so steeply as
to restrict the rearward thrust of the hind legs.
Chest: Deep and strong, but not too broad, with the deepest point being
just behind and level with the elbows.  The ribs are well sprung from
the spine but flattened on the sides to allow for freedom of action.

TAIL: The well furred tail of fox-brush shape is set on just below the
level of the topline, and is usually carried over the back in a graceful
sickle curve when the dog is at attention.  When carried up, the tail
does not curl to either side of the body, nor does it snap flat against the
back.  A trailing tail is normal for the dog when in repose.  Hair on the
tail is of medium length and approximately the same length on top,
sides and bottom, giving the appearance of a round brush.

### LIMBS



FOREQUARTERS: When standing and viewed from the front, the
legs are moderately spaced, parallel and straight.  Bone is substantial
but never heavy.  Dewclaws on forelegs may be removed.
Shoulders and arm: The shoulder blade is well laid back.  The upper
arm angles slightly backward from point of shoulder to elbow, and is
never perpendicular to the ground.  The muscles and ligaments
holding the shoulder to the rib cage are firm and well developed.
Elbows: Close to the body and turned neither in nor out.
Pastern joint: Strong, but flexible.
Pastern: Viewed from the side, pasterns are slightly slanted.
Forefeet: Oval in shape but not long.  The paws are medium in size,
compact and well furred between the toes and pads.  The pads are
tough and thickly cushioned.  The paws neither turn in nor out when
the dog is in natural stance.



FCI-St. N° 270 / 18.11.2022
HINDQUARTERS: When standing and viewed from the rear, the hind
legs are moderately spaced and parallel.  Dewclaws, if any, are to be
removed.

Upper thigh: Well muscled and powerful.
Stifle: Well bent.
Hock joint: Well defined and set low to ground.
Hind feet: Oval in shape but not long.  The paws are medium in size,
compact and well furred between the toes and pads.  The pads are
tough and thickly cushioned.  The paws neither turn in nor out when
the dog is in natural stance.

GAIT / MOVEMENT: The Siberian Husky’s characteristic gait is
smooth and seemingly effortless.  He is quick and light on his feet, and
when in the show ring should be gaited on a loose lead at a moderately
fast trot, exhibiting good reach in the forequarters and good drive in
the hindquarters.  When viewed from the front to rear while moving
at a walk the Siberian Husky does not single-track, but as the speed
increases the legs gradually angle inward until the pads are falling on
a line directly under the longitudinal center of the body.  As the pad
marks converge, the forelegs and hind legs are carried straightforward,
with neither elbows nor stifles turned in or out.  Each’hind leg moves
in the path of the foreleg on the same side.  While the dog is gaiting,
the topline remains firm and level.

### COAT


Hair: The coat of the Siberian Husky is double and medium in length,
giving a well furred appearance, but is never so long as to obscure the
cleancut outline of the dog.  The undercoat is soft and dense and of
sufficient length to support the outer coat.  The guard hairs of the outer
coat are straight and somewhat smooth lying, never harsh nor standing
straight off from the body.  It should be noted that the absence of the
undercoat during the shedding season is normal.  Trimming of
whiskers and fur between the toes and around the feet to present a
neater appearance is permissible.  Trimming the fur on any other part
of the dog is not to be condoned and should be severely penalized.




FCI-St. N° 270 / 18.11.2022
Colour:  All ranges of the allowable colours which are black, grey,
agouti, sable, red and white. May be solid coloured. May have
multiple shades. May have white markings. A variety of symmetrical
or asymmetrical markings and patterns are common, including
piebald. No preference should be given to any allowable colour,
marking or pattern. Merle or Brindle patterns are not allowable and
are to be disqualified. Merle is defined as a marbling effect of dark
patches against a lighter background of the same colour and is not to
be confused with a colour patch of banded guard hairs amid white, as
is seen in dogs with allowable piebald. Brindle is defined as darker
and lighter single-coloured guard hairs producing a vertical tiger
striping, not to be confused with banded guard hairs and a different
colour undercoat, which may produce some apparent horizontal
striping.


### SIZE AND WEIGHT:


Height at withers: Dogs:
53,5 - 60 cm.

Females: 50,5 - 56 cm.
Weight:
Dogs:
20,5 - 28 kg.

Females: 15,5 - 23 kg.
Weight is in proportion to height.  The measurements mentioned
above represent the extreme height and weight limits with no
preference given to either extreme.  Any appearance of excessive bone
or weight should be penalized.

SUMMARY: The most important breed characteristics of the Siberian
Husky are medium size, moderate bone, well balanced proportions,
ease and freedom of movement, proper coat, pleasing head and ears,
correct tail, and good disposition.  Any appearance of excessive bone
or weight, constricted or clumsy gait, or long, rough coat should be
penalized.  The Siberian Husky never appears so heavy or coarse as to
suggest a freighting animal; nor is he so light and fragile as to suggest
a sprint-racing animal.  In both sexes the Siberian Husky gives the
appearance of being capable of great endurance.  In addition to the
faults already noted, the obvious structural faults common to all breeds
are as undesirable in the Siberian Husky as in any other breed, even
though they are not specifically mentioned herein.
