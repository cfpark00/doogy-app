FCI-St. N° 36 / 05.05.2003
TRANSLATION: John Miller and Raymond Triquet.  Official
language (FR).

ORIGIN: France.

### DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THE OFFICIAL VALID



### STANDARD: 25.03.2003.



UTILISATION: Scent hound used for hunting rabbit, hare, fox,
roe deer and wild boar.

FCI-CLASSIFICATION: Group   6   Scent hounds and related

breeds.
Section 1.3 Small-sized hounds.
With working trial.

BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: This little basset has the
same qualities as the breed from which it is derived: the griffon
fauve de Bretagne. Very popular in its region of origin in the XIX
century, it earned a national reputation in the course of the last 30
years of the XX century.
Its exceptional aptitude for hunting has allowed it to win the
French Cup hunting trophy on rabbit a number of times and it has
become very popular.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: The basset fauve de Bretagne, is a
small, stocky hound, lively, rapid for its size. It benefits from
enormous energy coupled with excellent hardiness.

BEHAVIOUR / TEMPERAMENT: The bassets fauves de
Bretagne are impassioned hunters but are also excellent
companions of man, sociable, affectionate and equable. They
adapt themselves easily to all terrains, even the most difficult, and
to all quarry. When hunting they reveal themselves to be
courageous, wily, and obstinate, which makes them very
successful.
