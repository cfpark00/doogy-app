BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: The Caucasian Shepherd Dog
(CSD) is considered to be the breed taking its origin from ancient
Caucasian dogs.
The breed’s expansion covers territories from the Caucasian Range
and the steppe regions of Southern Russia.
The evolution of the breed was not only a result of natural selection
but also influenced by nations that inhabited the Caucasian Region.
Historically Caucasian Shepherd dogs were used for guarding and
safe-keeping of herds, flocks and dwellings from beasts of prey and
predators. The first mention of a large molossoid dogs used by the
army of Armenian Tsar Tigran the II dates from the 1st century BC.
Selection work with the breed started in the USSR in the 1920s.
Obligatory qualities such as physical power, self-confidence,
fearlessness, sharply developed hearing, good sight, and a dense and
waterproof coat have been cultivated in the process of selection.


FCI-St. N° 328 / 02.03.2011
All these qualities as well as endurance allows people to use the
Caucasian Shepherd Dogs in all kinds of climatic condition including
the most severe ones.


### GENERAL APPEARANCE:


The Caucasian Shepherd Dog is a harmonious built, large, strong dog
with plenty of bone and powerful muscular system; of a slight
rectangular format.
Sexual dimorphism is well pronounced. Males are masculine, with
well developed withers and a bigger head in comparison with
females. They are also more massive, bigger and often shorter in
body than females.
In dogs with longer coat-variety males have a distinctly pronounced
mane.

### IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS:


The body length exceeds the height at withers by 3-8 %. The length
of the forelegs averages 50-52% of the height at the withers. The
length of the skull correlates with the length of the muzzle as 3:2.

BEHAVIOUR AND TEMPERAMENT: Behaviour is steady,
active, self-confident, fearless and independent. The Caucasian
Shepherd Dog shows a devoted attachment to its master; it is an
excellent guard dog.

### HEAD



CRANIAL REGION: The head is large, massive, and broad in
cheekbones; when viewed from above the head looks like a wedge
with broad base.
Skull: Massive and broad; forehead is almost flat, with a marked but
not deep furrow. Superciliary ridges are developed, but not
protruding. Occipital bone inconspicuous.
Stop:  Noticeable but not clearly marked.




FCI-St. N° 328 / 02.03.2011


### FACIAL REGION:


Nose: Black, large, with correct open nostrils, not proceeding the
muzzle outline. A black nose in solid, spotted or piebald colours is
desirable but not obligatory (but genetic blue or liverbrown nose is
not allowed).
Muzzle: Broad and deep, gradually tapering towards the nose; with
strong jaws and chin; great depth and is well filled under the eyes.
The bridge of the nose is broad. The upper lines of the muzzle and
skull run parallel.
Lips: Thick, close-fitting, well pigmented.
Jaw / Teeth:  Teeth should be healthy, white, strong; incisors are
close to each other and in one line. Complete scissor or pincer bite:
(i.e.42 teeth).
Injured, broken or knocked out incisors or canines which do not
affect the use of the bite is of no consequence, neither is absence of
PM1s.
Cheeks: Well developed and emphasized by well pronounced
chewing muscles.

EYES: Moderate size, oval in shape, not too deep set, wide and
obliquely placed. The colour is different shades of brown from dark
to hazelnut. Eyelids are black, dry and close-fitting. Expression is
serious, attentive and inquisitive.

EARS: Moderate size, thick, triangular shape naturally pendant, high
and wide set. Inner part of ear is close lying to the cheeks. Ears are
traditionally cropped in country of origin. Natural ears are of equal
value.

NECK:   Of medium length, powerful, low set; rounded in the crosssection. Crest is pronounced especially in males.

### BODY:


Very well developed in all dimensions; broad, well-muscled and well
balanced.
Withers: Well pronounced, moderately long. The height at the
withers slightly exceeds the height over the rump.
Back:  Straight, broad, firm.


FCI-St. N° 328 / 02.03.2011
Loin:  Short, broad, slightly arched.
Croup: Moderately long, broad, rounded, slightly sloping to root of
the tail.
Chest: Long, broad, well ribbed up, deep in general as well as in its
frontal part; in cross-section has broad-oval shape. Ribs well sprung,
false ribs are long. The forechest is marked.

Underline and belly: Belly moderately tucked up towards rear.

TAIL:  Set on high, sickle curve or curled. In repose hanging down
reaching the hocks; when the dog is alert, tail can be carried above
the backline.

### LIMBS



### FOREQUARTERS:


General appearance: Well muscled. Viewed from the front, straight,
parallel forelegs that are set fairly wide apart.
Shoulder: Strongly muscled. Moderately long, broad, slanting to
form an angle of approximately 100 degrees with the upper arm. The
shoulder-blade lies close against the chest.
Upper arm: Strong and muscular, close fitting.
Elbow:  Placed strictly back in parallel axis; turning neither in not
out.
Forearm: Straight, massive, moderately long, well muscled; rounded
in cross-section.
Metacarpus (Pastern):  Short, massive; almost straight viewed from
the front and the side.
Forefeet: Large, rounded in shape, well arched, well-knit.

### HINDQUARTERS:


General appearance: Viewed from the rear straight, standing parallel
and moderately wide. The stifles and hocks sufficiently well
angulated when viewed from the side.  The hindquarters should not
be set too far back.
Thigh: Broad, well muscled, moderately long.
Stifle (Knee): Sufficiently well angulated.
Lower thigh: Broad, well muscled, moderately long.


FCI-St. N° 328 / 02.03.2011

backline is relatively stable during movement.

SKIN:  Thick, sufficiently elastic, without any folds and wrinkles.

### COAT:


Hair: Straight, coarse, stand-off coat with well developed undercoat.
The length of guard coat as well as the undercoat should not be less
than 5 cm. The coat on the head and forelegs is shorter and thicker.

furry. The longer outer coat forms “brushes” on the ears, a “mane”
around the neck and “trousers” on the back sides of the thighs.

black; diluted black or black in any combination or genetic blue or
liver brown colour.
