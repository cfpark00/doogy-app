Section1.3 Small-sized Hounds.

With working trial.

BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY:  At the turn of the century,
the system of shoots (hunting grounds) was introduced into several
Swiss Cantons. As the opinion was that the generally popular
medium-sized Swiss Hounds (Schweizer Laufhunde) were too fast
for enclosed shoots, it was decided to replace them with smaller
short-legged Scenthounds. The new smaller breed, bred through
planned selection of stock and suitable crossing, was called
“Niederlaufhund (“Short-legged Scenthound”). It distinguished itself
by the following qualities: relatively low at height at withers, coat
colours similar to the medium-sized Swiss Hounds (Schweizer
Laufhunde), with a melodious cry when hunting and searching and
with a very passionate determination to find game and to do track
work.
The Schweizer Niederlaufhund Club, first known by the name
“Schweizerischer Dachsbracken Club”, was founded on June 1st
