BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: Gundogs that are trained to
find live game and/or to retrieve game that has been shot and wounded
is a very old tradition, not the least in Great Britain. The Field Spaniel
belongs to the category of Flushing Spaniels that earlier was called
“Land Spaniels”. - Although Spaniels are capable of doing the same
work as Retrievers. The Field Spaniel is a product of crossing the onetime Sussex Springer and the Cocker Spaniel in the late nineteenth
century. Twice, the breed nearly disappeared, firstly when fashion fads
all but ruined the breed in the early 1900s and, secondly, when in the
1950s breed numbers were so small that the Kennel Club withdrew
championship status, this being restored in 1969 only after determined
efforts by breeders to maintain the breed. Still not a popular breed by
modern standards, but nevertheless makes a good companion for the
country dweller.
