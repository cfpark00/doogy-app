BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: One of the most ancient breeds
in the Iberian Peninsula, it owes its name to the village of Castro
Laboreiro, located in the Melgaço municipality in the extreme north of
Portugal, where it comes from.  It is a rustic mountainous area, ranging
from the M-inho River to the Peneda and Soajo Mountains with
altitudes of up to 1400 m. It is delimited by the Minho, Trancoso,
Laboreiro and Mouro rivers.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: The breed has a slight mastiff type.  A
vigorous animal, of attractive morphology and often of striking coat.  It
has a severe and serious expression and the rusticity of a mountaineer.

IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS: Moderately long (Sub-longilinear),
with length of body to height at withers relation of 7:6; the depth of the
chest is slightly less than half of the height at withers. The superior
cranium-facial axes are slightly divergent. The muzzle is slightly
shorter than the skull, i.e. skull to muzzle relation is 6:5.

BEHAVIOUR/TEMPERAMENT: A loyal and docile companion to
its family, it is essential in flock protection against wolf attacks which,
in the breed’s area of origin, are still very frequent.


FCI-St. N° 170 / 05.01.2011
Due to its constant vigilance, it is an ideal sentinel of property entrusted
to it, patrolling it frequently. Of noble nature. Very agile and active, it
can show some hostility, without being quarrelsome. It has a
characteristic alarm bark, starting with a deep sound, rising to lowpitched and ending in prolonged high-pitched sounds.

HEAD: Of medium size, showing lightness rather than coarseness;
smooth without being lean; skin well developed but without wrinkles;
long and tending to rectilinear.

### CRANIAL REGION:

The superior cranium-facial axes are slightly divergent with a profile
tending to rectilinear; The superciliary arches are slightly developed
with a hardly noticeable frontal furrow; the occipital protuberance is not
pronounced.
Stop: Not pronounced, placed at greater distance from the occipital
protuberance than from the tip of the nose.

open. Always black.

without being narrow or pointed.

falls down to the hock, hanging not too close between the fringed
buttocks; tail with thick and long hair, especially on the underside,
giving it a thicker look in the middle, with a very hairy underside on the
third part of the tail. It has a graceful scimitar shape and is usually
