BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: The Pumi came into being
during the 17th to the 18th century in Hungary by crossbreeding the
primitive Puli with imported German and French dogs of Terrier type
with prick ears. It has been recognised as an independent breed at the
beginning of the 20th century.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: The Pumi is a cheerful, medium sized
herding dog of Terrier type. His Terrier character is most obvious in
his head. The foreface is elongated and the upper third of the
otherwise prick ears is bending forward. The conformation is square.
Because of his constant alertness, his neck carriage is higher than
normal. The wavy coat of medium length forms curls. The Pumi can
have various colours but must always be of one solid colour.

### IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS:


•
The body length is equal to the height at the withers.


FCI-St. N° 056  / 13. 09. 2000
•
The depth of the brisket is slightly less than half of the height at
the withers.
•
The length of the muzzle is slightly less than half of the total
length of the head.
•
The length of the neck is equal to the length of the head and is 45
% of the height at the withers.

BEHAVIOUR / TEMPERAMENT: This rather lively herding dog
has a restless temperament. Extremely bold, a little suspicious
towards strangers. As a result of his sensible behaviour, his liveliness
and his expressiveness, he attracts attention always and everywhere.
The Pumi is rather noisy. His whole appearance embodies thirst for
action and because of his restlessness and activity, all parts of his
body are constantly on the move. He is always active and ready for
duty. A shy or phlegmatic behaviour are untypical of the breed.

HEAD: Relatively long and narrow. The shape of the head is
characterised by the elongated muzzle.

### CRANIAL REGION:


Skull: The top of the head is relatively broad and domed. The long
forehead is only slightly domed and flat seen from the side. The
superciliary ridges are moderately developed.
Stop: Barely perceptible, the forehead running an almost straight line
between the eyebrows towards the bridge of the nose.

### FACIAL REGION:


Nose: Narrow, bluntly cut-off. Always black in all coat colours.
Muzzle: The bridge of the nose is straight. The elongated facial
region tapers towards the nose but is never pointed.
Lips: Tight-fitting to the teeth, dark pigmented.
Jaws/Teeth: Strong jaws. The strong, well developed teeth are white.
Regular, complete scissor bite according to the dentition formula.
Cheeks: Well muscled.




FCI-St. N° 056  / 13. 09. 2000

oval, dark brown slit-eyes. The expression is lively and intelligent.

pigmented.

EAR: The upright ears are set on high, the upper third of the ears
bending forward. The medium sized, even ears show a reverse Vshape. They show alert reactions to all stimulations.

NECK: Of medium length, little arched, well muscled, forming an
angle of 50 to 55 degrees to the horizontal. The skin at the throat is
tight, dry, without folds.

hair on the underside of the tail is 7 to 12 cm long, wiry standing
apart, with little undercoat. A natural stumpy tail or tail docking are
not permitted.

### LIMBS



### FOREQUARTERS:


General appearance: The front legs, placed under the forechest,
support the body like pillars. They are vertical, parallel and not too
wide apart.


FCI-St. N° 056  / 13. 09. 2000
Shoulder: The shoulder blade is long and a little steep. Angle to the
horizontal is approximately 55 degrees. The points of the shoulder
blades are placed vertically above the deepest point of the brisket.
Upper Arm: Short and well muscled. The shoulderblade and the
upper arm form an angle of 100 to 110 degrees.
Elbow: Close-fitting to the body.
Forearm: Long, gaunt.
Pastern: Steep.
Forefeet: Rounded cat feet with well knit toes. The pads are springy.
Nails strong, black or slate grey.

### HINDQUARTERS:


General appearance: The hindlegs are very strong. Seen from the
side, they are somewhat extended beyond the rear. Seen from behind,
the legs are parallel, straight, standing neither too narrow nor too
wide apart.
Upper thigh: Muscular, long, sloping to the rear.
Stifle: On the same level as the elbows.
Lower thigh: Long, dry.
Hock joint: The hock is lean with clean outlines.
Metatarsus (rear pastern): Short, steep.
Hind feet: Like forefeet. Dewclaws are not desired.

GAIT/MOVEMENT: Quite lively and spirited. Stride short,
energetic, dynamic and harmonious. The posture is bold and proud.
The trot is light-footed and harmonious; the dog puts his hind feet
exactly into the foot prints of the forefeet.

SKIN: Without folds, strongly pigmented. The areas of bare skin are
black or slate grey.

### COAT


Hair: The wavy, curly coat forms tufts and is never smooth or
corded. The coat has an average length of 4 to 7 cm, growing to
smaller or larger tufts; it is elastic, shaggy and dense. It consists of a
strong, but not coarse, topcoat and a soft undercoat.



FCI-St. N° 056  / 13. 09. 2000
The dense, wiry protective hairs of medium length on the ears grow
upwards.  The eyes and the foreface are free of long hair. The desired
coat preparation is achieved by hand trimming. Smaller corrections,
done with scissors on head and legs, are possible. Preparing the
entire coat with scissors is not desirable.

Colour:
•
Grey in various shades (normally, the colour at birth is black,
turning grey with time).
•
Black.
•
Fawn (fakó). Primary colours: red, yellow, cream (a trace of
black or grey and a distinct mask are desirable).

A white mark on the chest less than 3 cm in diameter and/or a white
line on the toes are not faulty.

•
White.

The coat colour must always be intense and solid.

### SIZE AND WEIGHT:



Height at the withers:

Dogs:
41 to 47 cm; Ideal height: 43 to 45 cm.
Bitches:
38 to 44 cm; Ideal height: 40 to 42 cm.

Weight:
Dogs:
10 to 15 kg; Ideal weight: 12 to 13 kg.
Bitches:
8 to 13 kg; Ideal weight: 10 to 11 kg.

FAULTS: Any departure from the foregoing points should be
considered a fault and the seriousness with which the fault should be
regarded should be in exact proportions to its degree and its effect
upon the health and welfare of the dog.
