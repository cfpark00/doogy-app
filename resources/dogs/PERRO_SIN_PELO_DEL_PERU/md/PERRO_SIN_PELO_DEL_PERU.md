FCI-St. N° 310 / 26.10.2021
TRANSLATION: Brígida Nestler. Technical Supervision: Miguel
Ángel Martínez.
Latest amendments: Kennel Club Peruano.  Official language (ES).

ORIGIN: Peru.

### DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THE OFFICIAL VALID



### STANDARD: 15.09.2021.



UTILIZATION: Companion dog.

FCI-CLASSIFICATION:  Group  5
Spitz and primitive type.



Section 6
Dogs of primitive type.



Without working trial.

PREAMBLE: These dogs have been kept as a peculiarity because of
their genetic nature, the procreation of dogs with and without hair in
the same litter. Lost in the darkness of time the naked variety reached
a major milestone when it was officially recognized as a breed native
to Peru in 1985, during the ordinary Assembly of the FCI at
Amsterdam city, thanks to the initiative of the Cynologist Ermanno
Maniero, who did the first breed standard, it was possible that this
was registered as a new breed under the name of Peruvian Hairless
Dog with the number 310 of the nomenclature.
The recognition of the hairless dog did not eradicate the coated
relative into oblivion. Disdained from any breeding program, its
current recognition in the light of developments in the study of its
genome emphasizes the genetic value of the breed and contributes to
its development and preservation. The recognition of the coated
variety, for show and for breeding, favours the expansion of genetic
variability, improving the breed’s strength and attracts new breeders.
Initially, the specimens of the coated variety to be registered for the
first time, should be the product of the crossing of two hairless
singles duly inscribed in a studbook or an appendix, those that can
be mated only with specimens of the hairless variety and so
subsequently for generations to come. Crosses between dogs of the
coated variety are prohibited, such as entry of these to any register
without having duly registered parents.


FCI-St. N° 310 / 26.10.2021

BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: The Peruvian hairless dog,
known as “viringo”, because of its particular nature, was the subject
of obvious curiosity by the Peruvians from different times. Because
of the allocation of different properties, they are seen on ceramics of
different cultures pre-Incas like Vicus, Mochica, Chancay,  Chancay
with Tiahuanaco influence, Chimu and others where in many cases
the hairless dog has replaced the puma, the snake or the hawk,
standing with the greatest interest in the Chancay culture. As seen in
these illustrations, the hairless dog makes its appearance in the
archaeological periods of Pre-Inca times, from 300 BC until 1460
AD.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: Going by his general conformation, it
is an elegant and slim dog, whose aspect expresses speed, strength
and harmony without ever appearing coarse. There are two varieties,
the hairless whose main feature is the absence of hair all over the
body and the coated variety, that is entirely coated.
Another particular feature is that the dentition in the hairless variety
is nearly always incomplete associated with the congenital alopecia.

IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS:  The ratio between the height at
the withers and the length of the body is 1 : 1; the females can be
slightly longer than the males.

BEHAVIOUR/TEMPERAMENT:  Noble and affectionate at home
with those close to him, at the same time lively and alert; he might be
wary of strangers and is a good watch dog.

HEAD: Of lupoid conformation.

### CRANIAL REGION:


Skull: Mesocephalic. Orthoid, i.e. the upper axes of the skull and
muzzle are parallel; a slight divergence is accepted. Seen from
above, the skull is broad and the head tapers toward the nose. The
superciliary arches are moderately developed. The occipital
protuberance is barely marked.
Stop: Slightly marked (approximately 140°).


FCI-St. N° 310 / 26.10.2021

### FACIAL REGION:


Nose: Good pigmentation, the colour of the nose must be in harmony
with the different colours of the skin; in the different shades in the
hairless variety and with the colour of the hair in the coated variety.
Muzzle: Seen in profile, the nasal bridge is straight.
Lips: They must be as tight as possible and close to the gums.
Jaws/Teeth: The incisors should fit in scissor bite.  In the hairless
variety the absence of one or more teeth is accepted. In the coated
variety the dentition must be complete with teeth normally developed
and in a normal position. The jaw is not strongly developed.
Cheeks: Developed without exaggeration.
Eyes: Alert and intelligent expression. The eyes must be of average
dimensions, slightly almond shaped, neither deep-set nor prominent,
normally and regularly placed, i.e. neither too close together nor too
wide apart. The colour can vary from black, going through all shades
of brown to yellow, in harmony with the skin colour in the naked
variety and with the coat in the variety with hair.  In any case, both
eyes must be of the same colour. The colour of the eyelids may go
from black to pink in subjects with light coloured face.  The light
pink colours are admitted but not sought after.
Ears: The ears must be pricked when the dog is attentive, whereas at
rest, they are laid towards the back. The ears are of medium length;
broad at the base, tapering progressively towards the tip, ending
almost pointed. The ear set starts on the upper part of the skull to end
laterally and obliquely. In erect position, the axes of the ears form a
variable angle from 50° to near 90°.

### NECK:


Upper profile:  Curved (convex).
Length:  Approximately the same length as the head.
Shape: Near to a truncated cone shape, supple, with good
musculature.
Skin: Fine, smooth, elastic and really close to the subcutaneous
tissues. No dewlap.




FCI-St. N° 310 / 26.10.2021

BODY: Mesomorphic.

Topline: Level, although certain subjects show a dorsal-lumbar
convexity, which disappears at croup level.
Withers: Barely accentuated.
Back: Straight, with well-developed back muscles often forming all
along the back a muscular bi-convexity, which extends to the lumbar
region.
Loin: Strong and well-muscled. Its length reaches approximately 1/5
of the height at the withers.
Croup:
The
superior
profile
is
slightly
convex,
slanting
approximately 40° to the horizontal.  Solid and well-muscled giving
a good push.
Chest: Seen from the front, the chest perimeter must have good
amplitude, but without excess; reaching almost to the elbow. The ribs
must be slightly sprung, never flat. The chest, measured behind the
elbows, must exceed the height at the withers with approximately
18%.
Underline and belly: The lower profile presents an elegant and wellmarked line which goes from the lower part of the chest and rising to
the belly which must be well tucked up, but without excess.

TAIL: The tail is set on low, thick at the root it tapers towards the
tip. When excited, the dog can carry the tail raised in a loose curve
above the backline, but never as curved as being rolled up. At rest, it
hangs with a slight upward curve at the tip. The tail is sometimes
carried tucked in towards the abdomen. In length it almost reaches
the hock. Tail to be complete.

### LIMBS



### FOREQUARTERS:


General appearance: Well united with the body, seen from the front
they are perfectly upright with the elbows not turned out. The angle
at the shoulder/upper arm varies between 100° and 120°. Seen in
profile, the angle is 15° to 20°.


FCI-St. N° 310 / 26.10.2021
Forefeet:  Are semi-long and look like hare-feet. The pads are strong
and heat-resistant. The inter-digital membranes are well developed.
The black dogs have preferably black nails and the lighter coloured
dogs light nails.

### HINDQUARTERS:


General appearance: The muscles are rounded and elastic. The curve
of the buttocks is well marked. The coxo-femoral angle varies
between 120° and 130°. The femoro-tibial angle must be of 140°.
Seen from behind the hindquarters must be upright.
Hind feet: Same as forefeet.

GAIT / MOVEMENT: Due to the angulations defined at the
description of the limbs, some of these dogs move with shorter steps
but faster and at the same time quite soft and flexible. The limbs,
seen from front or behind must move in a single line (i.e. single
tracking).

SKIN: The skin must be smooth and elastic all over the body, but
can form a few rounded almost concentric lines on the head and
round the eyes and the cheeks in the hairless variety. It has been
verified that the internal and external temperature of the hairless dogs
is exactly the same as that of other breeds (coated or not). The
absence of hair leads to an immediate and direct emanation of heat,
different from the coated subjects, where the heat filters through the
coat by natural ventilation.

Colour:
The colour of the skin in the hairless variety can vary from black,
slate black, elephant black, bluish black, the whole scale of greys
(diluted black), bronze, copper, dark brown going to light blond. All
colours can be either uniform or show depigmented areas in any
part of the body, preferably on the chest, legs and tail,
nevertheless, the extension should not me more than 20 % of all the
body.  In equal conditions it is preferred solid colours.




FCI-St. N° 310 / 26.10.2021


### COAT



Hairless variety: Without hair, only very few hairs on the head and at
the extremities of the legs and the tail are admitted, and sometimes
sparse hair on the back. These hairs can be any colour or
combination of colours.
Coated variety: Smooth, short and tight coat. The hair can be any
colour or combination of colours, except merle.

### SIZE AND WEIGHT:


There are three sizes in the males and females.

Large: 51–65 cm.

The weight is in relation to the size.
Small: 4–8 kg.
Medium: 8–12 kg.
Large: 12–30 kg.
