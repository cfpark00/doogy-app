houses, property and other valuables, as well as for people. He has
also been used as a hunting and scenting dog.

Sheepdogs and Cattle
Dogs (except Swiss

Section 1
Sheepdogs.


Without working trial.

BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: The Kuvasz is a long
established, ancient Hungarian Shepherd Dog. His ancestors came
into the Carpathian basin at the time of occupation by the Magyars.
These dogs were needed to watch and guard their flocks against
beasts of prey and thieves. Because of his hunting instinct, the
Kuvasz was the preferred hunting dog at the time of King Matthias
Corvinus. Since the decline in stock-herding, he has much less been
used for his original duties and he has settled in villages and later
even in towns.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: The dogs of this breed are strong and
large and carry a dense, wavy, white coat. Their pleasing appearance
radiates nobility and strength. The individual body parts fit together
harmoniously, the limbs being neither too short nor too long.
The bone structure is strong but not coarse. The strong muscles are
lean, the joints show clear outlines.
Seen from the side, the body forms a prone rectangle, almost a
square. Well muscled he shows a strong build, a lively temperament
and great agility.


St-FCI n°54/13.09.2000

His appearance embodies a tireless working ability.

### IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS:


•
The body length slightly exceeds the height at the withers.
•
The deepest point of the brisket is approximately on a level with
half of the height at the withers.
•
The muzzle is slightly shorter than half of the length of the head.

BEHAVIOUR / TEMPERAMENT: The Kuvasz is brave and
fearless. He defends the people entrusted to his care and his
protection and their property, even with his life. He is self-confident
and may become aggressive if ill-treated. He is faithful, dependable
and loves his master and his surroundings. He needs plenty of
exercise and must be kept busy. He is undemanding. His care is easy
and he can stand very severe weather conditions. He appreciates any
love and solicitude given to him.

HEAD: The Kuvasz' head is typically wedge-shaped, in harmony
with his body, pleasing, noble, and it shows a considerable strength.
The Kuvasz can mainly be distinguished from other breeds by his
head shape. The head is characteristically lean and dry. In dogs the
head is slightly more massive than in bitches.

### CRANIAL REGION:


Skull: Broad, forehead slightly protruding. In the middle of the
forehead, there is a distinct furrow.
Stop: Barely pronounced.

FACIAL REGION: Broad, long, well muscled.
Nose: The black noseleather is cut off blunt.
Muzzle: The bridge of nose is straight. The muzzle tapers gradually
but is never pointed.
Lips: Black, tightly fitting. The corner of the mouth has jagged rims.
Jaws/Teeth: Well developed, strong, regular and complete scissor
bite, according to the dentition formula.



St-FCI n°54/13.09.2000
EYES: Set in slightly slanting, almond shaped, dark brown. The rim
of the eyelids is black and close-fitting to the eyeball.

EARS: Set on at medium height. One third of the ears lifts from the
base away from the skull in a curve, then dropping, lying close to the
head. The leathers are V-shaped with rounded tips. When alert, the
ears are slightly raised. Never prick or twisted.

NECK: Rather short than of medium length and well muscled.
Forms an angle of 25 to 30 degrees to the horizontal. Crest of neck is
short. Skin on throat taut, no dewlap. In male dogs, collar and mane
are significant.

BODY: Seen from the side, the body forms a prone rectangle, only
slightly differing from a square.
Withers: Long, rising markedly above level of back.
Back: Of medium length, straight, broad, well muscled and taut.
Loins: Short, in taut continuation of the back.
Croup: Slightly sloping, well muscled, broad. The very dense coat
gives the croup the appearance of being slightly overbuilt.
Forechest: Because of the strongly developed muscles, the forechest
is rounded, the point of the sternum only slightly protruding.
Chest: Deep, long and slightly arched.
Underline and belly: In continuation of the ribcage, tucked up
towards the rear.

TAIL: Set on low following the ligthly sloping croup in a straight
line. Vertically down with the tip curved slightly upwards, but not
crooked. When the dog is alert or roused, it may, at most, be raised to
the level of the topline.

### LIMBS



FOREQUARTERS: The front legs, supporting the body, are vertical
down to the carpal joints. They are parallel and moderately far apart.
Seen from the front, the position of the front legs is correct if a
vertical line drawn from the shoulder joint runs along the axis of the
front legs and meets the feet between the 3rd and 4th toes.


St-FCI n°54/13.09.2000
Seen from the side, the position is correct if a vertical line drawn
from the elbow joint to the ground, runs through the centre of the
legs down to the carpal joints.
Shoulders: Shoulder blade long, sloping, muscled. Close-fitting and
tight to the ribcage, but flexible.
Upper Arm: Of medium length, well muscled. The upper arm and the
shoulder blade form an angle of 100 to 110 degrees.
Elbows: Dry, close-fitting to the ribcage, turning neither in nor out.
Upper and lower arm form an angle of 120 to 130 degrees.
Forearm: Relatively long, straight, compact with lean muscles. With
strong sinews reaching down to the carpal joint.
Carpal joint: Well developed, taut, with sinews of steel.
Pastern: Relatively short, lean, sloping slightly (angle to vertical 10
to 15 degrees).
Forefeet: Round or slightly oval, taut. Toes are short and highly
arched so that their middle part does not touch the ground. Elastic,
well knit. Pads are springy, black. Nails are hard, strong, black or
slate grey in colour.

HINDQUARTERS: The position of the hind legs seen from the side
is correct if the stifle joint is positioned vertically below the iliac
crest and the foot under the hip joint. A vertical line from the
ischiatic tuberosity touches the heel bone. Seen from the rear, the
position of the hind legs is correct if a vertical line from the ischiatic
tuberosity runs along the axis of the limbs, being parallel to both
sides and meeting the ground moderately wide apart.
Upper thigh: With long, broad, massive muscles closely connected to
the pelvis. Pelvis and upper thigh form an angle of 100 to 110
degrees.
Stifle: Voluminous. The angle between upper thigh and lower thigh
is 110 to 120 degrees.
Lower thigh: The long massive muscles extend to the hock with
strong sinews. Seen from the rear, vertical and parallel on both sides,
also to the axis of the body.
Hocks: Broad, voluminous, dry, sinewy. Angle of hock 130 to 140
degrees.
Rear pastern: Long, vertical.
Hind feet: Oval, otherwise like the forefeet.


St-FCI n°54/13.09.2000

GAIT/MOVEMENT: Wide, slow steps. When trotting, the
movement is light footed, springy, ground covering, lively, constant
and tireless. Elbows turning neither in nor out.

SKIN: Well pigmented, slate grey and tight.

### COAT:


Hair: Moderately harsh, wavy, slightly stiff, not tending to mat.
Under the coarser topcoat, there is a finer downy undercoat.  The
head, ears and feet are covered by short (1-2 cm long), dense, smooth
hair.   The front and sides of the front legs as well as the hind legs
below the stifles are covered by equally short (1-2 cm long) straight
hair.
There are featherings of 5-8 cm in length on the back of the legs; on
the hind legs, they reach to the hocks.  The neck has a ruff which
extends to a mane reaching to the chest. This is particularly
pronounced in male dogs.
On body, upper thigh and upper arm, the coat is of medium length
(4-12 cm long), abundantly wavy and it forms crests, ridges and
tassels. The tail is covered, along its entire length, by dense, wavy
coat which can even reach a length of 10-15 cm at the hip of the tail.

Colour: White, ivory colour is permitted. Noseleather, rim of eyelids
and lips are black. Pads are black or slate grey. A dark colour is
desired for roof of mouth but pink patches are permissible.
