BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: The presence of this dog in
the Iberian Peninsula is most ancient. His origin is the same like that
of the old « Barbet ». His most dense population is in Andalusia
where he is used as a shepherd dog, and where he has been known
for centuries as the « Turkish dog ».  His characteristics, most
particularly the quality of his coat, are adapted to the variation of
humidity and drought of the marshy regions, which qualifies him as a
shepherd dog and as a helper to the hunters of waterfowl and
fishermen in those regions.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: Rustic dog, well proportioned
(medium weight), dolichocephalic, of rather elongated harmonious
shape and attractive appearance, of an athletic nature with well
developed muscles owing to his regular exercise; the profile is
rectilinear; his sight, hearing and scent are well developed.
