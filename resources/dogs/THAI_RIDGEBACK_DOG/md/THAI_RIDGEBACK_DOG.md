BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY:  The Thai Ridgeback Dog is
an old breed which can be seen in the archeological documents in
Thailand which were written about 360 years ago.  It was used
mainly for hunting in the eastern part of Thailand.  People also
used it to escort their carts and as a watch dog.  The reason why it
has kept its own original type for so many years is due to poor
transportation systems in the eastern part of Thailand; it had fewer
chances to crossbreed with other breeds.

GENERAL APPEARANCE:  Medium-sized dog with short hair
forming a ridge along the back.  The body is slightly longer than its
height at withers.  Muscles are well developed, and its anatomical
structure is suitable for activities.

Depth of chest :  Height at the withers =   1 :  2

BEHAVIOUR / TEMPERAMENT:  Tough and active with
excellent jumping ability.  A loyal family dog.

### LIMBS



### FOREQUARTERS :


Shoulder: Well laid back.
Forearm: Straight.
Pastern: Straight when seen from the front and very slightly
sloping when seen from the side.
Forefeet: Oval.  Nails black but can be lighter depending on coat
colour.

### HINDQUARTERS:


Thighs: Well developed with well bent stifles.
Hocks: Strong and well let down.
Rear Pastern: Straight and parallel when seen from the rear.
Hind feet: Oval

GAIT: Reachy stride with no pitching nor rolling of the body.
Parallel tracking at normal speed. When viewed from the front,
the forelegs move up and down in straight lines so that the shoulder,
elbow and pastern joints are approximately in line with each other.
When viewed from the rear, the stifle and hip joints are
approximately in line.  Movement in a straight line forward without
throwing the feet in or out; thus, enabling the stride to be long and
drive powerful.  The overall appearance of the moving dog is one of
smooth flowing and well balanced rhythm.

SKIN: Soft, fine and tight.  Throat: no dewlap.

### COAT


Hair: Short and smooth. The ridge on the top region is formed by the
hair growing in the opposite direction to the rest of the coat.  It
should be clearly defined from other parts of the back.  There are
various shapes and lengths of ridge, but must be symmetrical on
either side of the backbone and within the width of the back.
Crowns or whirls at the head of the ridge are acceptable.
