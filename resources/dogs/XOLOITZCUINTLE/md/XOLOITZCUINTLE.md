FCI-CLASSIFICATION: Group


## 5 Spitz and Primitive Types.



Section  6 Primitive Type.



Without working trial.

PREAMBLE: The gene that produces the absence of hair is
dominant. Nevertheless, some puppies are born with a coat. The
hairless to hairless breeding will produce the least numbers of coated
dogs therefore this has been preferred. It has been proven that this
breeding maintains and improves the quality of the breed.
For
providing
genetic
diversity,
well-constructed
coated
Xoloitzcuintles, with excellent type, conformation, standard
accepted colours and coat, may be used for breeding purposes.
The breeding between two coated Xoloitzcuintles is not permitted.
Xoloitzcuintle coated breeding stock must be the offspring of
registered parents with at least three generations of hairless to
hairless breeding. The coated variety must be evaluated as a true
breed at dog shows, to be able to be bred to hairless dogs only.

BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY:  Their origin dates far back
in history. The meat of the Xoloitzcuintle or Xoloitzcuintli in
Nahuatl language, Xoloitzcuintle in Spanish was considered a
delicacy in pre Hispanic Mexico, eaten by the indigenous Mexicans
in special ceremonies as a ritual to their beliefs and was regarded as
a representative of the god "Xolotl", from which its name
obviously originates.



FCI-St. N° 234 / 28.01.2014

Its task was to guide the souls of the dead to their eternal
destination.  Therefore, the dog became scarce, reaching a point of
near extinction. The Federación Canófila Mexicana (Mexican
Kennel Club) rescued this native breed and has used the
Xoloitzcuintle on its logo since 1940. The hairless variety of the
breed is also known by the name “perro   pelón mexicano"
(Mexican Hairless Dog).  The coated variety was known by the
natives as "itzcuintle".

### GENERAL APPEARANCE:


The Xoloitzcuintle is an ancient natural primitive dog, modelled
by evolution, going by the general conformation, it is a very
attractive slim and elegant dog, moderate in all aspects,  that
express  speed, harmony and strength without appearing coarse,
possess  a clean cut outline,  it has  a  well-proportioned body,
chest is ample,  ribs  well  sprung,  limbs  and  tail  are  long.
There are two varieties in the breed, hairless and coated, both
identical in conformation except for coat and dentition.
Hairless variety: The most important characteristic is the complete
or almost complete lack of any hair in the body, with a smooth
and soft skin. The particular feature is that the dentition is nearly
always incomplete, associated to the congenital hairless gene.
Coated variety: A very attractive, completely short coated dog.
Coat should be tight, flat and smooth with no undercoat. The
coated variety should have the same harmonious proportions as
the hairless variety in conformation, the dentition must be
complete (42 teeth) normally developed and in a normal position.

IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS: The body, measured from the
point of shoulder to the point of buttock and from the highest
point of the withers to the ground, is slightly longer than high:
approximately 10:9.  Females may be slightly longer than males
due to their reproductive function. The skull and the muzzle are
approximately of equal length.




FCI-St. N° 234 / 28.01.2014

There are three sizes in the breed, all lean and sturdy, wellmuscled, with a spacious ribcage and moderate bone, the outline
is rectangular and the distance from the elbow to the ground is
equal to or slightly greater than the distance from the withers to
the elbow.

BEHAVIOUR AND TEMPERAMENT: The Xoloitzcuintle   is a
silent and calm dog, cheerful, alert and intelligent, he might   be
suspicious toward strangers, he is a good watchdog and an
excellent companion. He is never aggressive. The coated variety
should be equal in every aspect.

### HEAD



### CRANIAL REGION:


Skull: Broad and strong, wedge-shaped. Seen from above it is wide
and elegant; tapering towards the muzzle with an occipital
protuberance that is not well-defined. The skull and muzzle planes
are almost parallel.
Stop: Slight, but well defined.

### FACIAL REGION:


Nose: The nose should be dark in dark-coloured dogs. It can be
brown or pinkish in bronze-coloured dogs, spotted in spotted dogs.
Muzzle: Seen from the side, the muzzle is straight and the upper and
lower jaws are square and very strong.  The tongue is generally pink
but may have black markings, spots or marks, which is a common
characteristic of the breed.  The tongue is always inside the mouth, a
paralyzed tongue hanging outside the mouth is disqualifying.
Lips: Tight and close fitting.
Jaws / Teeth: Both varieties: with strong jaws. The incisors should
close perfectly in a scissor bite with the superior incisors
overlapping; the interior surface of the superior incisors touching the
external surface of the lower incisors, set square to the jaw. A level
bite, edge to edge, is also permitted. Hairless variety: Complete set of
incisors is preferred.




FCI-St. N° 234 / 28.01.2014

The absence of a few incisors, canines, molars, pre-molars or rotated
teeth should not be penalized, as many dogs do not have deep roots.
Genetically, the absence of hair is closely linked to the absence of
teeth. Coated variety: Full dentition (42 teeth), a scissor or pincer
bite is required, normally developed and normally positioned teeth.
Cheeks: Slightly developed.

EYES: Medium size, almond-shaped, with an alert and very
intelligent expression. The colour varies according to the skin/coat
colour in black, brown, hazel, amber or yellow tones. Darker colours
are preferred and both eyes should match. The eyelids should be
well-pigmented black, brown or grey in dark-coloured dogs. Lightcoloured or pink eyelids are tolerated in light-coloured dogs but this
is not a desirable colour.

EARS: In both varieties the ears are long, large, expressive and very
elegant and of fine texture; they are reminiscent of “bat” ears. They
should be held erect when alert. In the alert position their axis should
be 50 – 80 degrees from horizontal.  Both ears should be in the same
position, when alert. Droopy or cropped ears are disqualifying.

NECK: In both varieties the neck is carried high, smooth and dry.
Slightly arched. Proportionately long. Slim, flexible, well-muscled
and very elegant. The skin on the neck is firm, elastic and closefitting, without dewlap. Puppies show folds which disappear with
age.

BODY: Strongly built.
Topline: Perfectly straight and level.
Back: Short, strong and firm.
Loin: Strong and muscular.
Croup: Profile should be slightly convex with an inclination of
approximately 40 degrees to the horizontal.
Chest: Seen in profile it is long and deep, descending to the elbows.
The ribs are well sprung, not exaggerated, nor flat. Seen from the
front the upper chest is of good breadth.  The point of the sternum
should not protrude.



FCI-St. N° 234 / 28.01.2014

Underline and belly: Graceful line. Abdomen muscled and
moderately tucked up.

TAIL: Long, thin and may have some tufts of hair, tapering from the
base to the tip in the hairless variety, and completely covered with
short hair in the coated variety. In movement, it is carried up in a
curve, never touching the back. When resting, it should hang with a
slight curve at the end. Sometimes it is placed between the legs due
to cold temperatures. The tail should nearly reach the hock. The tail
set should be an extension of the croup when the dog is at rest.

### LIMBS



### FOREQUARTERS:


Shoulder: Flat and muscled with good scapula-humeral angulation
which allows a long, free and elegant stride.
Elbow: Strong and firm. They fit close to the chest, never turned
outwards.
Forearm: Forelegs seen from the front are straight and perpendicular
to the ground.
Metacarpus (Pastern): Firm and almost perpendicular.
Forefeet: Of medium length (hare’s foot) with toes arched and close
together, may have short coarse hairs in the Hairless variety, and be
covered with short hair in the Coated variety. Nails are black in darkcoloured dogs, and lighter in bronze or blond dogs. The nails should
be trimmed. The foot pads are strong and very resistant to any
terrain. The inter-digital membranes are well-developed. Dewclaws
should not be present on all four limbs except in countries where it is
illegal to remove them.

### HINDQUARTERS:


General appearance: The hindquarters should be strong and wellmuscled. Seen from behind they are perfectly straight and parallel
and never close. The angle of the pelvis to the upper thigh joint, stifle
and hock, are adequately open to permit both free and strong
movement of the legs.




FCI-St. N° 234 / 28.01.2014

Thigh: Well-muscled.
Stifle (Knee): With a moderate bend.
Hock joint: Cow hocks are highly undesirable.
Hind feet: As forefeet.

GAIT / MOVEMENT: The dog should move freely with a long,
elegant, springy step; the trot is quick and flowing with head and tail
carried high. Hindquarters with free and strong movement.

### SKIN:


Hairless Variety: Due to the total absence of hair, the skin of this
breed is of great importance. It is smooth, sensitive to touch and feels
warmer because of direct heat emission due to the lack of hair;
however, its body temperature is the same as in other dogs with hair.
The difference with haired breeds, which disperse body heat through
natural ventilation, is that the skin requires more care from exposure
to the sun and elements due to its lack of natural protection.
Accidental scars are not penalized. The dog tends to sweat through
its feet (foot pads and inter-digital membranes), which is why it
seldom pants, except in extreme heat. It should be free of obvious
skin problems.
Coated Variety: The skin of the coated variety is smooth and must
be completely covered with hair.

### COAT


Hair:
Hairless variety: The characteristic of this breed is the total lack of
hair on the body (hairless or nude dog) although there are some
short, coarse thick hairs of any colour on the forehead and back of
the neck that should never be longer than 2.5 centimetres and should
never form a long, soft topknot.  It is common to find coarse hair on
the feet and on the end of the tail; however its absence should not be
penalized.
Coated Variety: This variety has hair all over its body. It can be
expected to have very little hair on its belly and inside the rear legs.

The hair should be short, flat, preferably smooth and with no
undercoat.


FCI-St. N° 234 / 28.01.2014
