UTILIZATION: Racing dog.

FCI-CLASSIFICATION:  Group  10  Sighthounds.

Section 3
Shorthaired sighthounds.

Without working trial.

BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: The little Italian Sighthound
descends from small-sized sighthounds that already existed in
ancient Egypt at the court of the Pharaohs. Passing through Laconie
(Greece), where numerous representations on vases and bowls
confirm this, the breed arrived in Italy at the outset of the 5th century
BC. Its greatest development occurred during the era of the
Renaissance at the court of the nobles. It is not rare to find the Italian
Sighthound represented in the paintings of the greatest Italian and
foreign masters.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: Of slender appearance, its body fits
into a square. Although of a small size, it fully characterizes a
miniature sighthound, the prototype of refinement and elegance. May
be considered as a model of grace and distinction.

IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS: The length is equal to or only just
inferior to the height at the withers. Length of skull is equal to half
the length of the head. Length of head can reach 40% of the height at
the withers.

BEHAVIOUR/TEMPERAMENT: Lively, affectionate, docile.



FCI-St. N° 200 / 17.12.2015
HEAD:  Of elongated shape and narrow.

### CRANIAL REGION:


Skull: Flat with the superior axes of the skull and muzzle parallel.
Length of the skull is equal to half the length of the head, which has
slightly rounded sides. Lower orbital region well chiselled. Muscles
of the head must not show any heavy appearance. Marked eyebrow
bones. Not prominent occiput. Only slightly marked median
depression.
Stop: Frontal nasal depression only very slightly marked.

### FACIAL REGION:


Nose: Of a dark colour, preferably black with well-opened nostrils.
Muzzle: Tapered.
Lips: Thin and tight, with edges of lips very darkly pigmented.
Jaws/Teeth: Jaws elongated with well-aligned incisors crown shape,
strong in relation to size of dog. Teeth sound and complete set square
to the jaws; scissor bite.
Cheeks: Lean.
Eyes: Large, roundish, and expressive, sub-frontally positioned,
neither deep-set nor protruding. Iris of dark colour, eye rims
pigmented.
Ears: Set very high, small, with fine cartilage, folded in itself and
carried well back on the nape and upper part of the neck. When the
dog is attentive, the base of the ear is erected and the lobe tends to
stand out laterally on the horizontal, position commonly known as
“flying ears” or “propeller ears”.

NECK: The nape is slightly arched and broken at its base towards
the withers. The throat line is slightly convex.  Neck length equal to
that of the head. Shaped like a truncated cone, well-muscled. Skin
lean without dewlap.

BODY: The length is equal to, or barely inferior to the height at the
withers.




FCI-St. N° 200 / 17.12.2015
Topline: Straight profile with slightly arched dorsal-lumbar region.
The lumbar curve is merging harmoniously into the line of the rump.
Withers: Quite well defined with closely placed top of shoulders.
Back: Straight, well muscled.
Loin: Slightly arched.
Croup: Very sloping, wide and muscled.
Chest: Narrow, solid but elegantly modelled with slight spring of
ribs. Deep, let down to the elbows.
Underline and belly: The rather short sternal arch is accentuated and
rises without abruptness to the belly.

TAIL: Low set, fine even at base, tapering progressively to its tip. It
is carried low and straight in its first half, the second half curved.
Stretched it should reach the top of the hock. Covered with short
hair.
