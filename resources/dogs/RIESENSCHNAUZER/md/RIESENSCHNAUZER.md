### RIESENSCHNAUZER


(Giant Schnauzer)




FCI-St. N° 181 / 10.06.2021


TRANSLATION: Mrs. C. Seidler. Official language (DE).

ORIGIN: Germany.

### DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THE OFFICIAL VALID



### STANDARD: 25.05.2021.



UTILIZATION: Utility and Companion Dog.

### FCI-CLASSIFICATION:


Group 2
Pinscher and Schnauzer-
Molossoid breeds - Swiss
Mountain and Cattle
Dogs.

Section 1
Pinscher and Schnauzer
type.

With working trial.



BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: Originally the Giant
Schnauzer was used in the region of Southern Germany to drive
cattle.  Around the turn of the century, determined breeders realised
that he had outstanding working capabilities and particularly
valuable traits in character.  Since 1913 the breed has been registered
in a stud book, and in 1925 already the Giant Schnauzer has
officially been recognised as a working dog.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: Large, powerful, stocky rather than
slim.  An enlarged, powerful image of the Schnauzer. An
imperturbable dog, prepared for defence, whose appearance fills with
respect.

### IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS:


• Square build in which height at the withers is nearly equal to the
body length.




FCI-St. N° 181 / 10.06.2021

• The length of the head (measured from the tip of the nose to the
occiput) corresponds to half the length of the topline (measured
from the withers to the set on of the tail).

BEHAVIOUR / TEMPERAMENT: Typical characteristics of this
dog are his good natured, even temperament and his incorruptible
loyalty towards his master.  He has highly developed sense organs,
intelligence, trainability, strength, endurance, speed, resistance to
weather and diseases.  His inborn ability to bear strain and his self-
assurance make him best suited for being a companion, sporting,
utility and working dog.

### HEAD



### CRANIAL REGION:


Skull: Strong, long without markedly protruding occiput.   The head
should be in keeping with the dog’s force.  The forehead is flat,
without wrinkling and parallel to the bridge of nose.
Stop: Appears well defined due to the brows.

### FACIAL REGION:


Nose: Well developed nose leather with large nostrils, always black.
Muzzle: Ending in a blunt wedge. Bridge of nose straight.
Lips: Black, smooth and tight-fitting to the jaws.  Corners of lips
closed.
Jaws/Teeth: Strong upper and lower jaw.  The complete scissor bite
(42 pure white teeth, according to the dentition formula), is strongly
developed and firmly closing.  The chewing muscles are strongly
developed but the cheeks must not interfere with the rectangular
shape of the head (with the beard).

EYES: Medium sized, oval, facing forward, dark with lively
expression.  Eyelids close fitting.



FCI-St. N° 181 / 10.06.2021
EARS: Drop ears, set high, V-shaped with inner edges lying close to
the cheeks, evenly carried, turned forward towards temples. Folds
parallel, should not be above the top of the skull.


NECK: The strong, muscular neck is nobly arched, blending
smoothly into the withers.  Strongly set on, slim, noble curved,
corresponding to the dog’s force.  Throat skin-tight fitting without
folds.

### BODY


Topline: Slightly sloping from withers towards rear.
Withers: Forming the highest point in topline.
Back: Strong, short, and taut.
Loins: Short, strong, and deep.  The distance from the last rib to the
hip is short to make the dog appear compact.
Croup: Slightly rounded, imperceptibly blending into tail set on.
Chest: Moderately broad, oval in diameter, reaching to the elbows.
The forechest is distinctly marked by the point of the sternum.
Underline / Belly: Flanks not too tucked up, forming a well curved
line with the underside of the ribcage.

TAIL: Natural; a sabre or sickle carriage is sought after.

### LIMBS



### FOREQUARTERS:


General appearance: Seen from the front, the front legs are strong,
straight, and not close together.  Seen from the side, the forearms are
straight.
Shoulder: The shoulder blade lies close against the rib cage and is
well muscled on both sides of shoulder bone, protruding over the
points of thoracic vertebrae.  As sloping as possible and well laid
back, forming an angle of appr.50° to the horizontal.
Upper arm: Lying close to the body, strong and well-muscled,
forming an angle of 95° to 105° to the shoulder blade.
Elbows: Close fitting, turning neither in nor out.


FCI-St. N° 181 / 10.06.2021
Forearm: Viewed from all sides completely straight, strongly
developed and well-muscled.
Carpal joint:  Strong, firm, barely standing out against the structure
of the forearm.
Pastern: Seen from the front, vertical.  Seen from the side, slightly
sloping towards the ground, strong and slightly springy.
Forefeet: Short and round, toes well-knit and arched (cat foot) with
short dark nails and resistant pads.

### HINDQUARTERS:


General appearance: Standing obliquely when seen from the side,
standing parallel but not close together when seen from the rear.
Upper thigh: Moderately long, broad, and strongly muscled.
Stifle: Turning neither in nor out.
Lower thigh: Long and strong, sinewy, running into a strong hock.
Hocks: Very well angulated, strong, firm, turning neither in nor out.
Metatarsus: Short, vertical to ground.
Hind feet: Toes short, arched, and well-knit.  Nails short and black.

GAIT / MOVEMENT: Flexible, elegant, agile, free and ground
covering.  The front legs swinging as far forward as possible, the
hind legs, ground covering and springy, provide the necessary drive.
The front leg of one side and the hind leg on the other side move
forward at the same time.  The back, the ligaments and the joints are
firm.

SKIN: Tight fitting over the whole body.

### COAT



Hair: The coat should be wiry, harsh, and dense.  It consists of a
dense undercoat and a not too short topcoat, lying close to the body.
The topcoat is rough and sufficiently long to allow the checking of
its texture; it is neither bristly nor wavy.  Hair on the limbs tends to
be less harsh.  Coat short on forehead and ears.  Typical
characteristics are the not too soft beard on the muzzle and the bushy
eyebrows which slightly shade the eyes.



FCI-St. N° 181 / 10.06.2021
Colour:
• Pure black with black undercoat
• Pepper and Salt
When breeding Pepper and Salt, the aim is a medium shading
with evenly distributed, well pigmented, pepper colouring and
grey undercoat.  The shades from dark iron grey to silver grey are
all permitted.  In all colour variations there must be a dark mask,
which should adapt harmoniously to the respective colour,
emphasizing the expression. Distinct light markings on head,
chest and limbs are undesirable.
• Black/Silver
For the Black/Silver colour, the aim in breeding is a black
topcoat with black undercoat, white markings over the eyes,
on the cheeks, at the beard, at the throat, in two divided
triangles at the front of the chest, on the front pasterns, on the
feet, on the inside of the hind legs and around the anus. The
forehead, the neck and the outer sides of the ears should be
black like the topcoat.

### SIZE AND WEIGHT:


Height at withers: Dogs and bitches: 60 to 70 cm.
Weight:                 Dogs and bitches: 35 to 47 kg.

FAULTS: Any departure from the foregoing points should be
considered a fault and the seriousness with which the fault should be
regarded should be in exact proportion to its degree and its effect
upon the health and welfare of the dog.
