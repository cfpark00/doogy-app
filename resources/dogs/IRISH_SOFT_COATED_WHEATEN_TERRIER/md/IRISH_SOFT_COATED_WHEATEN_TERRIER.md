### IRISH SOFT COATED WHEATEN TERRIER





St-FCI n°40/25.04.2001
ORIGIN: Ireland.

### DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THE OFFICIAL VALID



### STANDARD: 27.01.2001.



UTILIZATION: Wheaten Terriers were always used by small
farmers to kill vermin or help with the work about the farm.  They
were used for a long time in the difficult job of hunting badgers and
otters.

### FCI-CLASSIFICATION:


Group  3
Terriers.
Section 1
Large and medium

sized Terriers.
Without working trial.

BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: The history of the Irish Soft
Coated Wheaten Terrier has been somewhat obscured by its
closeness to the other Irish Terrier breeds.  The Wheaten is probably
the oldest of the four breeds.  Its existence for at least 200 years can
be inferred from textual references to "soft-coated" dogs.  The
relation of the modern Irish Terrier to the Wheaten, though less well
documented, appears to have been the result of deliberate breeding
experiments.  So the humble Wheaten probably has a fairly mixed
ancestry.  Despite the long history of the Wheaten, it wasn't until
1937, that the Soft Coated Wheaten was officially recognised by the
Irish Kennel Club.  The breed has grown steadily in popularity since
and is now well known world-wide.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: A hardy, active, short coupled dog,
well built, giving the idea of strength.  Not too leggy nor too low to
the ground.

BEHAVIOUR / TEMPERAMENT: Spirited and game.  Good
tempered.  Most affectionate and loyal to his owners.  Most
intelligent.  A trusty, faithful friend, defensive without aggression.




St-FCI n°40/25.04.2001

proportion to the body.  Hair same colour as on body.

neither undershot nor overshot.

EYES: Dark, dark hazel, not too large, not prominent, well placed.

EARS: Small to medium, carried in front, level with skull.  Dark
shading on base of ear allowed and not uncommon, accompanied by
a light wheaten coloured overlay.  This is the only area of the dog
where under-coat is allowed.  "Rose" or "flying" ears are
objectionable.

NECK: Moderately long and strong but not throaty.

approximately the same as from ground to withers.

The tail is docked so that two thirds of its original length remains
assuming it is in proportion to the dog.  An undocked tail is
permitted.

### COAT


Hair: A single coated dog.  Texture soft and silky to feel and not
harsh.  Young dogs excluded from this.  Trimming permitted.
Trimmed dogs: Coat cut close at neck, chest and skull, and left
especially long over eyes and under jaw. Whiskers encouraged.
Profuse feathering on legs.  Body coat trimmed to follow the outline
of the dog but not sculpted.  Tail trimmed close and neatly tapered.
Untrimmed dogs: The coat at its longest not to exceed five inches
(12,7 cm).  Soft, wavy or loosely curled with the sheen of silk.
Under no circumstances should the coat be "fluffed out" like a
Poodle or an Old English Sheepdog.  Dogs shown in this condition
should be heavily penalised as they give a wrong impression of type
and breed.  Special attention is drawn to puppy coat development.



St-FCI n°40/25.04.2001
Pups are seldom born with the correct coat of maturity, care must be
taken when assessing this point.
They go through several changes of colour and texture before
developing the mature adult coat.  This usually occurs between 18
months and 2½ years.
Pups: Are seldom born with the correct colour or texture coat.  They
come reddish, greyish and sometimes clear wheaten.  The masks are
generally black.  Sometimes there is a black streak down the centre
back or black tips to the body coat.  These dark markings clear away
with growth.

Colour: A good clear wheaten of shades from light wheaten to a
golden reddish hue.

### SIZE AND WEIGHT:


Height at the withers: Dogs 18-19 inches (46-48 cm).


Bitches somewhat less.
Weight:
Dogs 40-45 lbs (18- 20, 5 kg).

Bitches somewhat less.

FAULTS: Any departure from the foregoing points should be
considered a fault and the seriousness with which the fault should be
regarded should be in exact proportion to its degree and its effect
upon the health and welfare of the dog.
• Nervousness.  Viciousness.
• Nose any colour other than black.
• Undershot mouth.  Overshot mouth.
• Overall mature coat not clear wheaten colour.

•  White coat.  Brown coat.



St-FCI n°40/25.04.2001
Dogs carrying any of the above eliminating faults should never be
bred from.


### N.B:


•  Male animals should have two apparently normal testicles fully
descended into the scrotum.
•  Only functionally and clinically healthy dogs, with breed typical
conformation, should be used for breeding.
