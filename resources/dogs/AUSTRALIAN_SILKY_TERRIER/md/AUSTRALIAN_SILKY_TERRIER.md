BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY:  The two main ancestors of
this breed were the Australian Terrier and the Yorkshire
Terrier. During the period 1820-1830 a Broken Coated Terrier
bitch of a blue sheen colour, which was bred in Tasmania, was
taken to England and mated to a Dandy Dinmont Terrier. A Mr
Macarthur Little of London purchased some puppies from this
litter and experimented with further breeding to produce the soft
silky coat. Later Mr Little migrated to Sydney Australia and
continued his breeding programme using both Australian
Terriers and Yorkshire Terriers. These dogs soon spread though
out the Colonies of Australia and the Australian Silky Terrier
was establishes as a breed. A standard for the breed was first
drawn up in the early 1900’s.

courageous and dignified Toyterrier, that is second to none as a
