### GRIFFON BLEU DE GASCOGNE


(Blue Gascony Griffon)





FCI-St. N° 32 / 29.08.2023

TRANSLATION: Mrs. Peggy Davis.  Official language (FR).

ORIGIN: France.

### DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THE OFFICIAL VALID



### STANDARD: 01.08.2023.



UTILIZATION: Multipurpose hound used for hunting the hare with
the gun.  His keenness and fine nose make of him also a precious
assistant in the tracking of the wild boar.

### FCI-CLASSIFICATION:


Group  6
Scenthounds.

Section 1.2 Medium sized hounds.

With working trial.



BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: Of very ancient Pyrenean
origin, he is the offspring of the crossing of a medium sized Gascony
Blue with a Griffon.  After having practically disappeared from the
official dog fancy, the breed is actually experiencing an important
revival.

GENERAL APPEARANCE:  Griffon of rustic appearance, solidly
built, being halfway between the two breeds from which he is issued.

BEHAVIOUR / TEMPERAMENT: Fine nose, good voice, intent in
his way of hunting, but also full of keenness and enterprise.
Temperament alert, even overwhelmingly agitated but yet
affectionate.

### HEAD:



### CRANIAL REGION:


Skull: Seen from the front, slightly domed and not too broad; the
occipital protuberance is lightly marked.  Seen from above, the back
of the skull is ogival in shape.  The forehead is full.
Stop: Not very accentuated.



FCI-St. N° 32 / 29.08.2023


### FACIAL REGION:


Nose: Black, large, nostrils well open.
Muzzle: Practically the same length as that of the skull.  Nasal bridge
straight or slightly arched.
Lips: Lightly developed but covering the lower jaw.
Jaws/Teeth: Scissor bite.  Incisors set square to the jaws.
Cheeks: Lean.

EYES: Oval shape; dark chestnut.  Very expressive and lively.

EARS: Leathers supple, curled in without excess, very slightly
pointed; must reach the beginning of the nose without going beyond
its extremity.  Set just below the eyeline.

NECK: Rather slender, with a little dewlap.

### BODY


Back: Well supported, firm; short.
Loin: Muscled, slightly arched.
Croup: Very slightly oblique.
Chest: Well developed.  Ribs rounded without exaggeration.
Underline and belly: Flank full; underline slightly tucked up towards
the back.

TAIL: Quite hairy; just reaching the point of the hock; well set;
carried gaily sabre fashion.

### LIMBS

FCI-St. N° 32 / 29.08.2023


### HINDQUARTERS:


General appearance: Vertical and parallel legs.  Hindquarters well
developed.
Thigh: Well muscled.
Hock: Well let down.
Hind feet: Oval shape, toes lean and tight.  Pads and nails black.

GAIT / MOVEMENT: Supple and lively.

SKIN: Quite thick, supple.  Black or strongly marbled with black
patches, never entirely white.  Mucous membranes (hairless zones)
black.

### COAT


Hair: Hard, rough and shaggy.  A little shorter on the head where the
eyebrows, quite bushy, do not cover the eyes.  Much shorter and flat
on the leathers.

Colour: Entirely mottled (black and white) giving a slate blue effect;
marked or not with more or less extended black patches.  Two black
patches are generally placed at either side of the head, covering the
leathers, surrounding the eyes and stopping at the cheeks.  They do not
meet on top of the skull, they leave a white interval in the middle of
which is frequently found a little black oval shaped spot, typical of the
breed.  There are two more or less bright tan markings above the
superciliary arches giving a “quatroeuillé” effect to the eyes.  Equally
one finds traces of tan on the cheeks, the lips, the inner face of the
leathers, on the legs and under the tail.

### SIZE:


Height at the withers:  Males:
50 to 57 cm.


Females:
48 to 55 cm.



FAULTS: Any departure from the foregoing points should be
considered a fault and the seriousness with which the fault should be
regarded should be in exact proportion to its degree and its effect upon
the health and welfare of the dog.
