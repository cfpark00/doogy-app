BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: Scent hounds have been
known in Sweden since the 16th century. Hunting with hounds was
up to 1789 a privilege for royalty and gentry only. It was not until the
end of the 18th century that the ban that had prevented the peasantry
from hunting the land was lifted. Hounds earlier kept only by the
nobility became known and commonly spread. The origin of the
Hamiltonstövare is believed to be a mixture of scent hounds from
Southern Germany, Switzerland as well as Foxhounds and Harriers.
At the first dog show in Sweden in 1886 some 189 scent hounds
were on exhibition. Among them were a dog and a bitch, named
Pang and Stella, owned by Count Adolf Patrik Hamilton. This couple
is considered to be the origin of the Hamiltonstövare, or as the
hounds initially were called, Swedish hound. The breed gained the
name Hamiltonstövare in 1921 as a homage to the man that had
created the breed, the founder of the Swedish Kennel Club, Count
A.P. Hamilton.
