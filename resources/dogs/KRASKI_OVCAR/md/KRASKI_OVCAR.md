BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: The Karst Shepherd Dog is a
breed which has existed for several centuries and which belongs in
the molossian group.  Probably this dog followed the Illyrians in
their migration through Istria and the Dalmatian islands and settled in
the Slovenian region of the Karst Massif.  The breed was mentioned
in writing for the first time in 1689 in the book of Baron Janez
Vajkart Valvasor « The glory of the duchy of Carniole ».  The breed
and its standard were officially recognized on the 2nd June 1939
under the name of « Illyrian Shepherd » during the general assembly
of the F.C.I. in Stockholm.  At the general assembly of the F.C.I. in
1948 in Bled-Slovenia, the standard was completed and the breed
recognized again.  Up to 16th March 1968 however, the Shepherd of
Illyria of the Karst Massif carried the same name as the shepherd
from the Sarplanina Massif.


FCI-St. N° 278 / 22.08.2001
In the presence of two shepherd dogs carrying the same name, the
Central Society of Yugoslavia decided to name the one from the
Karst  region « Shepherd from the Karst Massif » and the other one
« Sarplaninac ».  Since that day, those two breeds have been totally
independent.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: The Karst Shepherd Dog is of
medium size, harmonious, robust, endowed with a well developed
musculature and a strong constitution.  The tail and ears are hanging.
The coat is iron grey, long and abundant.

### IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS:

less than 9: 8.  Body a little longer in bitches.

• Width of skull (13 to 14 cm) equal to its length.

temperament, courageous and valliant but not biting, very devoted to
his master.  Incorruptibly good guard, distrustful of strangers;
pleasant companion dog and obedient, whilst maintaining a strong
individuality.

HEAD: Of pleasing appearance while being proportionately large in
relation to the body; it must be neither fine nor coarse.  The upper
profile of the skull and muzzle are slightly convergent.  Seen from
above, it is wide at ear level and tapers imperceptibly towards the
nose.  Seen in profile, it is deep and rounded.  The length of the head,
from the occipital protuberance to the tip of the nose, is of 24 to 26
cm.  The skull is a little longer than the muzzle.
