BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: The Komondor is an oldestablished Hungarian herding breed of Asiatic origin. His original
ancestors almost certainly came with the migrating Old Magyars,
living as stock-breeding Nomads, to the Carpathian basin.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: The Komondor is large in size and
powerfully built. His appealing outward appearance and dignified
deportment arouse respect and even fear in the observer. By nature
he is not ingratiating. His robust body is covered by matted, corded,
throughout dense, long hair. The body, seen sideways, forms a prone
rectangle, little deviating from a square. The thickly coated head
rises above the body. The tail is carried hanging down with its tip
bent upwards, almost horizontal. The coat colour is ivory.

### IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS:


•
The body length slightly exceeds the height at the withers.
•
The deepest point of the brisket is approximately on a level with
half of the height at the withers.
•
The muzzle is slightly shorter than half of the length of the head.



St-FCI n°53/13.09.2000
BEHAVIOUR / TEMPERAMENT: He has an imperturbable
courage in the guarding and defense of the herds entrusted to him
and the property and home of his master.
He attacks silently and duringly. He regards his territory as his own
property and will not tolerate any other living creature in it. His
nature is suspicious. During the day, he likes to keep a lying position
enabling him to control his area. At night, he is always on the move.

HEAD: Broad, in good proportion to the body. Even the dense
screen of hair does not make him appear out of proportion.

### CRANIAL REGION:



Skull: Domed, brows well developed.
Stop: Well developed but not too steep.

### FACIAL REGION:


Nose: Straight, cut off blunt, black.
Muzzle: Not pointed; bridge of nose straight.
Lips: Black, tightly fitting to mouth and jaw bones. Corner of mouth
jagged.
Jaws/Teeth: Jaws very well muscled, strong and powerful. Even and
complete scissor bite, according to the dentition formula.
Cheeks: Broad, of medium length.

EYES: Horizontally set, dark brown. The black rim tightly fitting to
the eyeball.

EARS: Set medium high on the domed skull. Clearly pendant from
the base and V- or U-shaped. Not raised neither when alert nor in
attack.

NECK: Very well muscled. Should form an angle of 35 degrees to
the horizontal. In quiet or peaceful situations, it is carried almost in
continuation of the backline. Rather short than of medium length.
Without dewlap or neck ruff.

### BODY:


Topline: Those parts of the body which form the topline are broad
and very well muscled.
Withers: Sufficiently long, clearly defined in front.
Back: Short.
Loin: Of medium length.
Croup: Broad, of medium length, slightly sloping.
Chest: Broad, well muscled. Brisket of medium depth, broad, long.
Underline: Slightly tucked up.

TAIL: Low-set, clearly pendant; tip of the tail shows a slight bend,
almost to horizontal. It is desirable that the tail reaches to the hock.
When alert, the tail is raised, at most, to the level of the back.

### LIMBS



FOREQUARTERS: Judging of the limbs is highly affected by the
long corded coat. Front legs are columnar and straight, parallel and
vertical seen from the front or the side. The chest is broad which


results in wide apart, strong and free moving legs. The limbs are
firmly connected to the body. Bone substance is strong and powerful.
Joints are large.
Shoulders: The shoulder blades are moderately sloping. Points of the
shoulder blades placed vertically over the deepest point of the chest.
Forefeet: Large, strong with well knit toes. Pads are slate grey, thick
and well padded. Toenails grey.

HINDQUARTERS: The position of the hind legs supports the body
with medium angulations. Continuing the croup of medium length,
broad, well muscled limbs are required.
Upper thigh: Strongly muscled, voluminous.
Hind feet: Longer than forefeet, otherwise similar. Dewclaws to be
removed.

GAIT/MOVEMENT: Light, free and even. The stride is wide and
ground covering.



St-FCI n°53/13.09.2000
SKIN: The skin contains a lot of pigment and is slate grey. Dark
pigment at the gums and the roof of mouth preferred.
Diminished pigment and pink skin undesirable.

### COAT


Hair: The whole body is covered by long hair. The coat consists of a
coarser topcoat and finer undercoat. The characteristic coat is
determined by the relation of the top coat to the undercoat. The
shaggy coat, that tends towards matting is a basic requirement. An
equally dense, wavy, corded coat also occurs. The smaller tufts of
hair are less or not matted at all.  The coat is longest on the croup, at
the loin region and on the rear of the upper thighs (at least 20-27cm).
On the back, at the sides of the chest and at the region of the shoulder
blades, it is of medium length (15-22 cm), at the cheeks, the
eyebrows, on top of the head, on the ears, the neck and the limbs, it
is shorter (10-18 cm) and at the lips and on the lower parts of the
limbs shortest (9-11 cm).  Neither a combed nor a completely
neglected coat are desirable.


Colour: Ivory colour.

### SIZE AND WEIGHT:



### HEIGHT AT WITHERS:



Dogs:
Minimum 70 cm.
Bitches:
Minimum 65 cm.

### WEIGHT:



Dogs:
50 – 60 kg.

The breed shows few faults in type and is largely uniform as it has
always been bred with the same target.




St-FCI n°53/13.09.2000
