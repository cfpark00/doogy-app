## 3 Terriers.



Section  2  Small-sized Terriers.

Without working trial.

BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: The Scottish Terrier Club
was formed in 1882, a year after the first standard for the breed
was drawn up, and just three years after the start of the breed as we
know it today by Capt Gordon Murray. He was strongly supported
by the founder and first chairman of the Kennel Club, Mr Sewallis
Evelyn Shirley.
The public image of this short-legged terrier from the Highlands is
often that of a dour Scot, but to his family and friends he is
affectionate and cheerful although he will soon rouse himself at the
slightest sound, with protectiveness as he prepares to guard his
house and home.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: Thick-set, of suitable size to go to
ground, which would preclude dogs of excessive body weight,
short-legged, alert in carriage and suggestive of great power and
activity in small compass. Head gives impression of being long for
size of dog. Very agile and active in spite of short legs.

IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS: Skull and foreface of equal
length.

BEHAVIOUR AND TEMPERAMENT: Loyal and faithful.
Dignified, independent and reserved, but courageous and highly
intelligent. Bold, but never aggressive.



FCI-St. N° 073  / 10. 01. 2011
HEAD: Long without being out of proportion to size of dog.
Carried on muscular neck of moderate length showing quality.

### CRANIAL REGION:


Skull: Nearly flat. Length of skull enabling it to be fairly wide and
yet retain narrow appearance.
Stop: Slight but distinct stop between skull and foreface just in front
of eye.

### FACIAL REGION:


Nose: Black. Large, and, in profile, the line from nose towards chin
appears to slope backwards.
Muzzle: Foreface strongly constructed and deep throughout.
Jaws / Teeth: Teeth large with perfect and regular scissor bite, i.e.
upper teeth closely overlapping the lower teeth and set square to the
jaws.
Cheeks: Cheek bones not protruding.

EYES: Almond-shaped, dark brown, fairly wide apart, well set
under eyebrows with keen, intelligent expression.

EARS: Neat, fine texture, pointed, erect and set on top of skull but
not too close together. Large, wide-based ears highly undesirable.

NECK: Muscular and of moderate length showing quality.

### BODY:


Topline: Straight and level.
Back: Proportionately short and very muscular.
Loin: Muscular and deep.
Chest: Fairly broad and hung between forelegs. Well rounded ribs
flattening to deep chest and carried well back. Powerfully coupling
ribs to hindquarters.

TAIL: Moderate length giving general balance to dog, thick at root
and tapering towards tip. Set on with upright carriage or slight bend.

### FAULTS:


Any departure from the foregoing points should be considered a
fault and the seriousness with which the fault should be regarded
should be in exact proportion to its degree and its effect upon the
health and welfare of the dog.

### DISQUALIFYING FAULTS


• Aggressive or overly shy dogs.
• Any dog clearly showing physical or behavioural abnormalities.

### N.B.:


• Male animals should have two apparently normal testicles
fully descended into the scrotum (this expression is
obligatory in every standard).
• Only functionally and clinically healthy dogs, with breed
typical conformation should be used for breeding.
