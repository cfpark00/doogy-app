BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: An obvious relative of the
Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, this dog is known in some countries
as the English Toy Spaniel, and derives his name from a dog which
was a great favourite of King Charles II. Toy spaniels have long
been treasured as pets both in England and on the Continent and
were bred to a smaller and smaller size from setter dogs which
established the type for spaniels. Basically these were little gun
dogs, but pampered by wealthy owners, admired for their
companionship and crossed with toy dogs from the East, giving
rise to their facial appearance.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: Refined, compact and cobby.

BEHAVIOUR AND TEMPERAMENT: Happy, intelligent, toy
spaniel, with distinctive domed head.  Reserved, gentle and
affectionate.

### HEAD
