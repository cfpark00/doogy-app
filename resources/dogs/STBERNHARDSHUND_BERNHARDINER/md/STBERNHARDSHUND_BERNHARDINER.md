BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY:  At the height of the Great St.
Bernard Pass, 2469 metres above sea level, a hospice was founded
by monks in the 11th century as a place of refuge for travellers and
pilgrims.  There, large mountain dogs have been kept since the
middle of the 17th century for guarding and protection.  The
existence of such dogs has been documented pictorially since 1695
and in a written document at the hospice in the year 1707.  The dogs
were soon in use as companion dogs and especially as rescue dogs
for travellers lost in snow and fog.   The chronicles about the
numerous human lives saved by these dogs from the « white death »,
published in many languages, and the verbal reports of the soldiers
who crossed the pass with Bonaparte’s army in 1800, spread the
fame of the St. Bernard, called Barry-dog at that time, throughout
Europe during the 19th century.  The legendary dog « Barry »
became the epitome of the rescue dog.  The direct ancestors of the St.
Bernard were the large farm dogs common in that region.  Within a
few generations and aiming to a defined ideal type, these dogs were
developed to the present day type of breed.
Heinrich Schumacher from Holligen near Bern was the first who
began to issue genealogical documents for his dogs in 1867.

In February 1884 the "Schweizerisches Hundestammbuch"(SHSB),
the Swiss Dog Stud Book, was started.    The very first entry was the
St. Bernard "Leon", and the following 28 registrations also
concerned St. Bernards.  On the 15th March 1884, the Swiss
St. Bernards-Club was founded in Basle.  On the occasion of an
international Canine Congress on June 2nd 1887, the St. Bernard dog
was officially recognized as a Swiss breed and the breed standard
was declared as binding.    Since then, the St. Bernard has been
regarded as the Swiss national dog.

### GENERAL APPEARANCE:


There are two varieties of the St. Bernard:
• Short-haired variety (double coat, “Stockhaar”):
• Longhaired variety.
Both varieties are of considerable size and of impressive general
appearance.  They have a balanced, powerful, sturdy, muscular body
with impressive head and an alert facial expression.

### IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS:


• Ideal relation of height at withers to length of body (measured
from the point of the shoulder to the point of buttocks) = 9 : 10.
• Ideal relation of height at withers to depth of chest see sketch
below.
• The total length of the head is slightly more than one third of the
height at withers.
• The relation of depth of muzzle (measured at its root) to length of
muzzle is almost 2:1.
• Length of muzzle to be slightly longer than one third of the total
length of the head.


### BEHAVIOUR/TEMPERAMENT:


Friendly by nature.  Temperament calm to lively; watchful.


HEAD: Powerful, imposing and very expressive.

### CRANIAL REGION:


Skull: Strong, broad, seen in profile and from the front slightly
rounded.  When the dog is alert, the set-on of the ears and the top of
the skull form a straight line, which slopes at the sides in a gentle
curve to the strongly developed high cheekbones.  Forehead falling
away steeply towards the muzzle.  Occipital bone only moderately
developed, superciliary ridges strongly developed.  The frontal
furrow, which starts at the base of the forehead, is distinctly
developed and runs up right in the middle of the skull.
The skin of the forehead forms slight wrinkles above the eyes that
converge towards the frontal furrow.  When the dog is at attention,
they are moderately visible; otherwise they are rather inconspicuous.
Stop: Distinctly pronounced.

### FACIAL REGION:


Nose: Black, broad and square.  Nostrils well opened.
Muzzle: Of even width.  Nasal bridge straight, with slight groove.
Lips:  Edge of lips black pigmented.  Flews of upper jaw strongly
developed, firm and not too pendulous, forming a wide curve
towards the nose.  Corners of mouth remain visible.
Jaws/Teeth: Upper and lower jaw strong, broad, equal in length.
Well developed, regular and complete scissor or pincer bite. Close
fitting undershot mouth without any space between the lower and the
upper incisors acceptable.  Absence of PM 1 (premolar 1) and M3
tolerated.

EYES: Of medium size.  Colour dark brown to nut-brown.
Moderately deep set with a friendly expression. Natural tightness of
lids desired.    A very small angular fold on the lower lids with the
haws only very slightly visible as well as a small fold on the upper
lids are permitted. Eye rims completely pigmented.

EARS: Of medium size, set on high and wide.  Strongly developed
burrs.  Flaps pliable, triangular with rounded tips.  The rear edges
slightly standing off, the front edges lying closely to the cheeks.
