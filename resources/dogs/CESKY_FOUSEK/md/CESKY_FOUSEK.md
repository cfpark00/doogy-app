### CESKY FOUSEK


(Bohemian Wire-Haired Pointing Griffon)




FCI-St. N° 245 / 07.08.2013
TRANSLATION: Mrs. C.Seidler.  Official language (DE).

ORIGIN: Formerly Czechoslovakia, now Czech Republic.

### DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THE OFFICIAL VALID



### STANDARD: 21.05.1963.



UTILIZATION: Pointing dog.

### FCI-CLASSIFICATION:


Group 7
Pointing Dogs.

Section 1.3 Continental
Pointing



Dogs, « Griffon » type.

With working trial.

BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: The Cesky Fousek was the
most widely kept wirehaired Pointing dog in the region of the present
day Czech and Slovakian Republics in the time before the first
World War.  This World War and its consequences were responsible
for the Cesky Fousek nearly dying out in the twenties.  The
regeneration of the breed was implemented.  The foundation for this
regenaration was brought about by some of the original typical
specimen from which the modern type of Cesky Fousek was evolved
by planned breeding.  At present its numbers are in second place for
all hunting breeds used in the Czech and Slovakian Republics.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: The Cesky Fousek is a medium sized,
wirehaired, noble pointer, whose general appearance shows strength
and endurance.  It is a multipurpose dog with inherent qualities for
field and water, as well as for work in woodland.  In spite of his
innate sharpness to vermine, he is easily trained and very devoted to
his mater.

HEAD: The lean, somewhat narrow and long head is set high on the
neck.  The muzzle is somewhat longer than the skull and the nasal
bridge is moderately arched (Ram’s nose).


FCI-St. N° 245 / 07.08.2013

### CRANIAL REGION:


Skull: In the upper part of the forehead and the cranial region
moderately domed and slightly rounded, somewhat broader in dogs
than in bitches.  The superciliary arches clearly defined and
pronounced so that they emphasize the impression of angularity of
the head and form deeper eye sockets.  The occiput is barely
noticeable.
Stop: Moderate, yet marked towards the forehead.

### FACIAL REGION:


Nose: Broad with open sensitive nostrils.  The colour of the nose
leather must always be dark brown.
Muzzle: Narrows moderately from eyes to nose.
Lips: Fairly strongly developed; form a flexible edge to the muzzle,
with the upper lip forming a moderate overlap.
Jaws/Teeth: Jaws strong, clearly defined and well muscled.  Teeth
strong, with scissor bite and full complement of teeth.

Eyes: The almond shaped eyes show a kind expression and denote an
astute nature.  The eye should be deep set, dark amber to deep
chestnut in colour.  The eyelids fit close to the eye, which they
enclose completely and are well developed; they are grey - black in
colour.

EARS: Leathers set on high and broad, narrowing markedly towards
the tips.  The length of the leathers reaches to two thirds of the
cheeks and the end of the leathers are moderately rounded.  They
must lie close to the head.

NECK: Of medium length with well developed muscles, yet dry and
set high at the withers.  The crest of the neck is moderately arched.

### BODY:


Back: The short firm back slopes from the well developed withers
towards the croup.
Loin: Short, relatively broad and moderately arched.
Croup: Moderately sloping, sufficiently broad and suitably long.


FCI-St. N° 245 / 07.08.2013

Chest: Together with the shoulder blade, seen from the front, the
chest forms a lyre shape.  The ribcage must be oval and its width in
proportion to the overall build of the dog.  The lower chest must
reach at least to the elbow joint. The forechest should be well
developed.  Seen from the side, the sternum should protrude clearly.
The ribcage is formed by well sprung ribs which are arranged in
good proportion throughout its entire length.
Underline and belly: Should be somewhat tucked up to facilitate free
movement, yet it must not give the impression of leanness.

TAIL: The sacral bone must be positioned so that the musculature
does not influence the tail carriage which should be horizontal or
only very slightly upwards.  Set-on should form a continuation of the
topline.  It is medium strong and docked by 3/5 of its length.

### LIMBS



### FOREQUARTERS:


Shoulder: The shoulder blade is distinguished by well developed
muscles.  The shoulder placement should be really sloping and form
a blunt angle with the upper arm.
Elbow: Must be firmly made and muscled.
Forearm: Upright and straight with pronounced, dry muscles.
Pastern: Should be relatively short, almost vertical and only
moderately sloping towards the front.
Forefeet: Compact; they have the shape of a blunt spoon, with well
arched, tight toes and strong nails of dark grey to black colour.  The
pads are thick and coarse and fully pigmented.  There is a  noticeable
atrophied remnant of webbing between the toes.

### HINDQUARTERS:


Pelvis: Must be sufficiently long.
Upper thigh: Broad, with well developed muscles.
Lower thigh: Slopes backwards; must have correct angulation to
enable flexible movement.
Hock joint: Not too high set, lean, with a long only moderately
protruding heel bone.


FCI-St. N° 245 / 07.08.2013

Rear pastern: Almost vertical, short and adequately strong.
Hind feet: The same shape as the front feet.  Dewclaws are removed.


GAIT / MOVEMENT: Movement should be completely regular at
walk and trot with the backline showing barely any deflection and
the footprints virtually covering each other at the trot.

### COAT


Hair:
Make up of coat: The coat consists of three types of hair:
• Undercoat: Soft and dense, 1,5 cm long.  Prevents dampness
penetrating to the skin and is almost completely shed in the
summer.
• Topcoat: 3 to 4 cm long, suitably harsh and coarse.  Close fitting.
• Guard hair: 5 to 7 cm long, especially harsh and straight.
Particularly noticeable on forechest, topline, flanks and shoulders.
On the front part of the front and hind legs, the coat is shorter and
coarse; it is longer on their rear side, forming feathering.  The tail
must not have a brush on the underside.
Coat on head: On lower jaw as well as on lips, the hair is longer and
softer, forming the beard, typical on this breed.  The hair on the
eyebrow points obliquely and noticeably upwards.  The forehead,
cranial region and cheeks are covered by short coarse hair.  Leathers
are covered by short, softer, smooth hair.

Colour: Permitted colours are:
• Dark roan with or without brown patches.
• Brown with ticked markings on forechest and lower part of the
limbs.
• Brown without any markings.

### SIZE AND WEIGHT:


Height at the withers:  Dogs:
60 to 66 cm.



Bitches:
58 to 62 cm.



FCI-St. N° 245 / 07.08.2013
Weight: Dogs:
Minimum 28 kg,



maximum 34 kg.

Bitches:
Minimum 22 kg,



maximum 28 kg.

FAULTS : Any departure from the foregoing points should be
considered a fault and the seriousness with which the fault should be
regarded should be in exact proportion to its degree and its effect
upon the health and welfare of the dog.
• Wrong proportion between length of the body and height at
withers.
• Short, wedge shaped or round head.
• Portruding eyes.  Eye colour other than as laid down in the
standard.
• Leathers too long or too low set.
• Neck too strong and too short with loose skin.
• Withers insufficiently defined.
• Steep croup.
• Insufficiently developed forechest, insufficiently defined sternum.
• Splayed feet or harefoot.  Too much hair on feet.
• Coat too fine, too short or too long.
• Insufficiently defined beard or eyebrows.
• Lack of pigment.
• Predominance of white colour (particolour is not permitted).

### DISQUALIFYING FAULTS:


• Aggressive or overly shy dogs.
• Any dog clearly showing physical of behavioural abnormalities.

### N.B.:


• Male animals should have two apparently normal testicles fully
descended into the scrotum.
• Only functionally and clinically healthy dogs, with breed typical
conformation should be used for breeding.
