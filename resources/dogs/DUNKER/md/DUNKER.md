Section 1.2  Medium-sized Hounds.

With working trial.

BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: The Norwegian Hound is
named after the Norwegian captain Wilhelm Conrad Dunker,
who created the breed by crossing several scent hound breeds in
the first half of the 19th century. The county’s hound group was
large and included local hare hounds from all over the country.
A characteristic trait of the Norwegian Hound has always been
the blue-marbled (merle) coat colour and walleyes, although the
breed standard also allows other colours. During the Second
World War numbers declined but interest increased significally
after the war and up to the 1970s, after which the popularity
again dwindled. In the 1980s, the breed was very homogenous
with excellent hunting abilities. However, due to inbreeding,
most dogs were too closely related hence application were made
at several stages and eventually granted was given for some
crossbreeding which resulted in breed much better genetic
variation and health, still maintaining the typical and positive
characteristics. Unfortunately, the population figure is still low.
GENERAL APPEARANCE: Medium sized, distinctly rectangular,
powerfully built, but should not appear heavy.  Should convey the
impression of endurance.



FCI-St. N° 203/ 03.06.2016
IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS: Depth of brisket approximately
half of the height at the withers.
BEHAVIOUR/TEMPERAMENT: The Norwegian Hound is
considered to be the hardy and robust scent hound of old times, a
dog with an excellent temperament. The breed is characterized
by strong nerves and by being especially sociable and trusting.
They are known to have done well in hunting trials. They can
thus be characterized as an excellent combination of a hunting
and companion dog. Due to its good temperament and open
nature, the breed is also easy to train.
