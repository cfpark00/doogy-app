### IRISH WATER SPANIEL




FCI-St. N° 124  / 08.11.2002

COUNTRY OF ORIGIN: Ireland.


### DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THE OFFICIAL VALID



### STANDARD:  13.03.2001.



UTILISATION: The Irish Water Spaniel can be easily adapted to
suit most forms of shooting he will hunt, often point and retrieve
readily from heavy cover.  The construction and nature of the breed
has traditionally made it the choice of the wildfowler.

FCI-CLASSIFICATION:  Group   8   Retrievers, Flushing Dogs,
Water Dogs.

Section 3  Water Dogs.

With working trial.

BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY:  The exact origins of the
breed remain obscure.  Generally it is thought that Water Spaniels
evolved from dogs that originated in Persia and came to Ireland via
Spain.  The first Irish reference to “ water dogs that pursue water
fowl” dates from 1600, so we know that dogs with waterproof coats
were used in Ireland even before the advent of the fowling piece.
There is no real evidence of the ancestry of the Irish Water Spaniel
except in its most peculiar feature-the rat tail.   This feature appears
in no similar dog and makes it very likely that the modern breed had
an indigenous Irish ancestor.   The tail has given rise to the names “
Whip Tail” and “ Rat Tail”.  In any event the descendants of these
dogs were accepted and achieved great success on show benches in
the second half of the 19th century.  In 1890 the Irish Water Spaniel
Club was formed to promote the interests of the breed.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: Smart, upstanding, strongly built,
compact or cobby.



FCI-St. N° 124  / 08.11.2002
BEHAVIOUR / TEMPERAMENT: Proud, combining great
intelligence and endurance with a bold and dashing eagerness of
temperament, immense stamina and loyalty.
A good family dog with a sense of humour but discerning with
strangers.

HEAD: Skull and head should be of good size.

### CRANIAL REGION:


Skull: Skull high in dome, good length and width allowing for large
brain capacity.  Top knot should consist of long loose curls growing
down into a well defined peak between the eyes and should not be in
the form of a wig, i.e. growing straight across.
Stop: Gradual.

### FACIAL REGION:


Face: perfectly smooth.  Hair grows in a narrow line forming a beard
at the back of the lower jaw.
Nose: Large and well developed and of dark liver colour
Muzzle: Long, strong and somewhat square in appearance
Jaws/Teeth: Strong and regular with scissors bite.

EYES: Comparatively small almond-shaped, dark amber or dark
hazel and very intelligent looking.

EARS: Very long and lobe-shaped in the leather, set low, hanging
quite close to the cheeks and covered with long, twisted curls of hair.

NECK: Fairly long, strong and arching, (enabling the head to be
carried well above the level of the back) and strongly set into the
shoulders.

BODY: Should be of good size, being as a whole so proportionate as
to give a barrel-shaped appearance accentuated by the springing of
the ribs, overall strong and well- muscled.
Back: Short, broad and level, strongly coupled to the hindquarters.
Loin: Deep and wide.


FCI-St. N° 124  / 08.11.2002
Chest: Deep, but not too wide or round between the forelegs, though
large girth with ribs well sprung behind the shoulders.  Ribs carried

4 inches  - 7.5cm to 10cm with short curls), and gradually tapering,
ending in a fine point.  It should not be long enough to reach the
hock joint, and should be carried nearly level with the back in a
straight line.

### COAT


Hair: Dense, tight, crisp ringlets, entirely free from woolliness but
with a natural oiliness.  The back and sides of the neck should be

the lower jaw to the breastbone.  The forelegs covered with feather,
