BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: The Fox Terrier in booth
forms, Smooth and Wire, is from British origins and probably owes
its existence to the same types of dog which produced both the Bull
Terrier and the Black and Tan (now Manchester) Terrier. Uniformity
of type was established in the late 1800s and the original standard
for the Fox Terrier drawn up in 1876.
One of the most lively and alert of terriers, refinement to his present
show excellence has not allowed him to become unsound. Capable
of standing up to any amount of exercise, always ready to deal with
rats, rabbits, and, of course, foxes.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: Active and lively, bone and strength
in small compass, never cloddy or coarse. Neither leggy nor too
short in the leg, standing like a well made, short-backed hunter,
covering a lot of ground.
