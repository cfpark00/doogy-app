BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: In 1853 an Appenzell Cattle
Dog was first described in the book “Tierleben der Alpenwelt”
(Animal Life in the Alps) as a “high-pitch barking, short-haired,
medium size, multicolour cattle dog of a quite even Spitz type, which
can be found in certain regions and is used partly to guard the
homestead, partly to herd cattle.” In 1895, the great promotor of the
breed, head-forester Max Siber, asked the SKG (Schweizerische
Kynologische Gesellschaft, Swiss Cynological Society) to do
something for the breed.  1898 the executive authorities of the
Canton St. Gallen put the sum of SFr. 400.- at disposal to support the
breeding of the Appenzell Cattle Dog.  The SKG then formed a
special commission, the characteristic traits of the breed were fixed,
and at the fair at Altstätten 9 dogs and 7 bitches appeared; they
received prizes between SFr.5. to 10-. As a result, 8 Appenzell Cattle
Dogs were shown at the first international dog show in Winterthur
and entered in the newly introduced, separate class “Cattle Dogs”.



FCI-St. N° 46  / 05.05.2003
At the instigation of Prof. Dr. Albert Heim, who commited himself
very much to the Swiss Cattle Dogs and with them also to the
Appenzell Cattle Dog, the “Appenzeller Sennenhund Club” was
founded in 1906.  Its purpose was to preserve and promote the breed
in its natural state.  With the compulsory registration of puppies in
the “Appenzeller Dog Stud Book” the aim of selective pure-breeding
was begun.  In 1914 Prof.Heim set up the first valid breed standard.
The original breeding territory was the Appenzell region.  Today the
breed is distributed all over Switzerland and beyond its borders and
bred in many European countries.  The notion “Appenzeller
Sennenhund” is clearly defined nowadays and the breed, as such,
quite distinct from the other Swiss Cattle Dogs.  Although the
Appenzell Cattle Dog has found many admirers, the breeding stock
is still very small.  It is only by responsible and careful breeding that
it will be possible to establish and consolidate its natural and
outstanding hereditary qualities.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: Tricolour, medium-sized, almost
squarely built dog, balanced in all parts.  Muscular, very agile and
deft, with a cheeky expression.

compact than long.

watchdog which cannot be bribed, and capable of learning.

towards the muzzle.  Occiput barely pronounced.  Frontal furrow
moderately developed.

dark brown, brown; in havana brown dogs lighter brown, but as dark
as possible.  Eye-lids close fitting.  Eye-rims black respectively
brown (as dark as possible) corresponding to the colour of the coat.

EARS: Set on fairly high and broad; in repose hanging down flat and
close to cheeks.  Triangular shape with tips slightly rounded off.  In
alertness raised at set-on and turned forward so that the head and
ears, seen from above, form a marked triangle.

reddish-brown and white markings as symmetrical as possible.

over the bridge of the nose and can reach totally or partially
round the muzzle.
