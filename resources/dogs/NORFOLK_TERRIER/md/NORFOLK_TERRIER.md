BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: The Norfolk and Norwich
Terrier take their names, obviously, from the county and the city,
though turning the clock back to the early and mid-1800s there
was no such distinction, this being just a general farm dog. Glen
of Imaals, red Cairn Terriers and Dandie Dinmonts are among the
breeds behind these East Anglian terriers and from the resultant
red progeny emerged the present Norwich and Norfolk Terrier.
A typical short-legged terrier with a sound, compact body which
has been used not only on fox and badger, but on rats as well. He
has a delightful disposition, is totally fearless but is not one to
start a fight. As a worker he does not give up in the face of a
fierce adversary underground, and his standard’s reference to the
acceptability of ‘honourable scars from fair wear and tear’ is a
good indication of the type of. The Norwich Terrier was accepted
on the Kennel Club Breed Register in 1932, and were known as the
drop-eared Norwich Terrier (now known as the Norfolk Terrier) and
prick-eared Norwich Terrier. The breeds were separated in 1964 and
the drop-eared variety gained the name Norfolk Terrier.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: One of the smallest of terriers. Low,
keen dog, compact and strong, short back, good substance and bone.
Honourable scars from fair wear and tear permissible.
