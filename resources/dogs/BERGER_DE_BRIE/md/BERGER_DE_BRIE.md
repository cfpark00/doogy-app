FCI-CLASSIFICATION: Group  1 Sheepdogs and Cattle Dogs


(except Swiss Cattle Dogs).

Section 1 Sheepdogs.

With working trial.

BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: Known for a long time as
Chiens de Berger français de Plaine (French Lowlands Sheepdog).
It was in 1809, in the Abbot Rozier’s “Complete Agricultural
Course””, that the name “chien de Brie” appeared for the first time.
It was bred and selected for its herd-driving and guarding aptitudes.
The French army also used it during the two world wars as, among
other activities, sentinel and ambulance dog searching for the
wounded in the war fields.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: The Briard is hardy, supple, muscled
and well proportioned; lively and alert.

IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS: The Briard is of medium build.
The length of the body, from the point of shoulder to the point of
buttock, should be slightly greater that the height at withers.
The head is long: 2/5th of the height at withers.  The width of the
skull is slightly less than ½ of the length of the head.  The skull and
the muzzle are of equal length.


BEHAVIOUR/TEMPERAMENT: Balanced temperament, neither
aggressive nor timid.
The Briard should be steady and fearless.



St-FCI n°113/23.01.2009

HEAD: Strong, long, covered with hair forming beard, moustache
and eyebrows slightly veiling the eyes.  Seen from the side, the lines
of the skull and muzzle are parallel.

### CRANIAL REGION:


Skull: Strong, very slightly rounded seen from the side.
Stop: Pronounced; at equal distance from the occiput and the tip of
the nose.

### FACIAL REGION:


Nose: Strong. The nostrils are well open. The nose is always black
except in blue dogs which have either a blue or bluish nose.
Muzzle: The end of the muzzle is rather square. Muzzle
strong, sufficiently broad and  never pointed.
Nosebridge: Straight.
Lips: Lips are tight fitting
Jaws/Teeth: Strong jaws; white teeth. Scissors bite.

EYES: Oval. Horizontal, well open, rather large and of dark colour.
In blue dogs, paler coloured eyes are permitted.

EARS: Set on high, not plastered against the head and rather short if
left natural. The length of the cartilage of the uncropped ear should
be equal to or slightly less than half the length of the head.  The ears
are always flat and covered with long hair. If cropped, in countries
where this practice is not forbidden, they should be carried erect,
neither divergent nor convergent.

NECK: Muscled and springing well up from the shoulders

### BODY:


Topline: The back is straight. The loin is short and firm.
Crou : Only slightly sloping, of slightly rounded shape.
Chest: Wide and long, well let down to the elbows: ribs well sprung.




St-FCI n°113/23.01.2009
TAIL: Natural, carried low, it reaches at least the hock joint, without
deviation, forming a slight hook like a “J”. In action, the tail may be
carried at the highest in prolongation of the topline.

LIMBS: Well muscled with strong bone and upright.

### FOREQUARTERS:


Shoulder: Oblique, well angulated, moderately long, fitting closely to
the thoracic wall.
Elbow: In line with the body.
Forearm: Straight and muscled.
Metacarpus (Pastern): Slightly sloping, seen from the side.
Forefeet: Strong, round and well in axis with the body. The nails are
always black (except in blues) and the pads hard. Toes should be
well knit and arched.

### HINDQUARTERS:


Upper thigh: Muscled.
Hock joint:  Not too low down and well angulated.
Metatarsus (Rear pasterns): Perfectly vertical, seen from behind.
Hind feet: Strong, round. The nails are always black (except in blues)
and the pads hard.  Toes should be well knit.
Dewclaws: By tradition, the shepherds want to keep the double
dewclaws.  The dewclaws form thumbs, well separated and with
nails, relatively close to the foot.

GAIT/MOVEMENT: Regular, supple, harmonious, in a manner
which allows the dog to cover ground and accomplish its work with a
minimum of effort and fatigue. The Briard should have a long trot
with good reach and good thrust from behind.

lighter shade.  All colours may show different degrees of greying.
