### COAT


Hair: Smooth, thin, close lying and shining; without bare patches.

spots of the skin.  Orange ticking on the ears is highly characteristic
of the breed.

### For bitches between


53 and 56 cm (21,5 to 22,5 inches)

FAULTS : Any departure from the foregoing points should be
considered a fault and the seriousness with which the fault should be
regarded should be in exact proportion to its degree and its effect
upon the health and welfare of the dog.

### DISQUALIFYING FAULTS:


• Aggressive or overly shy.
• Any dog clearly showing physical or behavioural abnormalities.
• Lack of type.
• Eyes or nose light; excessive lack of pigment.
• Tail furnished with some longer and coarser, slightly off-standing
hairs (like ears of grain).
• Coat harsh and thick.
• Orange mantle.
• Orange spots too bright, tending to mahogany, greyish or mingled
with black hairs.  Distinct orange spots but too pale, and even the
absence of spots is not sought after but are not considered as an
eliminatory fault.
• Excess or lack of height at withers.  An exception may be made
for males which, excelling in their quality and therefore capable
of being used at stud, reach the maximum height of 60 cm
(24 inches).


FCI-St. N° 30  /  22.04.1997
• Any fault affecting the utilization of the dog, as rickets, lack of a
correct stance, insufficient reach of the movement.

### N.B.:


•
Male animals should have two apparently normal testicles fully
descended into the scrotum.
•
Only functionally and clinically healthy dogs, with breed
typical conformation should be used for breeding.
