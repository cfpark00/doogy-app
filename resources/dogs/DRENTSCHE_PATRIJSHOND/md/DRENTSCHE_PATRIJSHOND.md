ORIGIN: The Netherlands.

### DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THE OFFICAL VALID



### STANDARD: 04.04.2016.



UTILIZATION: Pointing Dog.

FCI-CLASSIFICATION:  Group
Pointing Dogs.

Section  1.2 Continental  pointing



dog, Spaniel type.

With working trial.

BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: In the 16th century, the breed
originated from the Spioenen (also called Spanjoelen) which came
via France from Spain. In the Netherlands they were called Partridge
dogs. In the eastern part of the country, especially in the province
Drenthe, these dogs were kept purebred and were not mixed with
foreign breeds as done elsewhere. On the 15th of May 1943, the
breed was officially recognised by the Raad van Beheer op
Kynologisch Gebied in Nederland. This was strongly promoted by
Baroness Van Hardenbroek, Mr. Van Heek Jr. and Mr. Quartero. The
breed is related to the Small Münsterländer and the Epagneul
Français. The breed club, the Nederlandse Vereniging « De
Drentsche Patrijshond» was founded on 5 June 1948.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: A well proportioned, dryly muscled
and clean-cut dog, whose body shows power and also the ability to
develop the necessary speed for a gundog. The head is slightly
wedge-shaped. The muzzle is a little shorter than the length of the
skull and rather dry, without hanging lips.




FCI-St. N° 224 / 17.05.2016
The coat, though not really long on the body, looks like a long coat
because of the well feathered ears and somewhat thicker fur on the
neck and chest, the feathered front and hind legs, and the longhaired, bushy tail, gives the impression of a long coat.

IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS: The length of the body, measured
from the point of forechest to the buttock is more than the height of
the withers, which makes a slightly longer appearance.
The length of the upper arm is slightly less than the length of the
shoulder blade.
The length of the muzzle is slightly less than the length of the skull.

BEHAVIOUR / TEMPERAMENT: An ideal dog for hunting in
varying fields. The dog hunts within range of the gun. Keeping in
touch with the hunter is apparently an innate quality. A characteristic
of the breed is that when searching the game, the tail moves in a
circular motion, especially when the dog picks up the scent of game.
When approaching the game, the dog points the game as solid as a
rock and impeccably waits for the hunter to come near; when this
takes a long time, the dog will look back for its master. The breed
has the adaptability that makes it capable of hunting all sorts of game
in the field and in water. In addition, they are good retriever and
finds lost game. These characteristics are innate, therefore need little
training. Because of their gentle character, it is harmful to use
forceful training methods. The Drentsche Patrijshond can be reserved
in the beginning, but never fearful. The dog is loyal and intelligent
which makes him, together with a good upbringing and training, a
highly esteemed family pet dog as well as a valuable companion of
the hunter.

HEAD:  The head is wedge-shaped and moderately long, fitting into
the overall picture, with a dry and fluid line.




FCI-St. N° 224 / 17.05.2016


### CRANIAL REGION:


Skull: The skull is rather broad and only slightly rounded. Along the
mid-line there is a hardly perceptible furrow from the shallow stop
half-way up to the moderately developed occiput.
Stop: The transition from the skull to the muzzle from both the side
profile and the front view is gradual; the cheeks tapering gradually
into the muzzle with well filled under the eyes. The eyebrow arches
are well developed and clearly visible.

### FACIAL REGION:


Nose: The nose is well developed and brown. The nostrils are wide
open.
Muzzle: The muzzle is powerful and tapering slightly to the nose tip
and is slightly shorter than the skull, blunt at the end with dry, not
pendulous lips. Well filled under the eyes. The nasal bridge is
straight and broad. A slight curve upwards, just behind the nose tip is
allowed.
Lips: The lips are rather thin, tightly fitting and brown.
Jaws/Teeth: The bite is a strong and a well fitting scissor bite.
Cheeks: Moderately developed.

EYES: The eyes are wide apart and set in such a way that they are
well protected; neither protruding nor deep set. They are of moderate
size and oval shaped. The expression shows kindness as well as the
intelligence of the hunting dog. The desired colour is amber,
therefore neither dark nor the light colour of the bird of prey; the
eyelids are close fitting.

EARS: Not heavy. They are set high; hanging close to the head
without any fold. Drawn forward, they should reach as far as 3
fingers breadth off the tip of the nose. They are broad at the set,
ending in a blunted point. When the attention of the dog is drawn, the
ears turn forward and are pulled up.


FCI-St. N° 224 / 17.05.2016
Seen from the front, the ear then forms a triangle with the fold above
the middle of the ear lap. The ears are mobile, expressing different
moods.

NECK: Powerful, of medium length, forming a smooth transition
between the head and body, with no interruption taking place. A
longer than desirable neck, giving a more elegant impression, but
lacking in power, is undesirable.

### BODY:


Topline: Smooth line from withers to tail.
Withers: Powerful and not placed too far forward.
Back: Strong and straight, of medium length, not too short, giving
together with the well angulated front- and hindquarters the
impression of being slightly elongated.
Loin: Strongly muscled.
Croup: Slightly sloping, broad and long.
Chest: Deep, reaching to the elbows and rather broad in front. The
forelegs must not be hindered by too much spring of the front ribs.
Long ribcage, with the hind ribs also well developed. Good spring of
ribs; ribs neither flat nor barrel shaped.
Underline & Belly: Only slightly tucked up.

TAIL: Carried in the continuation of the topline. The tail reaches
approximately to the hock. In action, the tail is partly horizontal, the
last part in a slight curve upwards. Never curled over the back. With
the exception of the root, rich feathering on all sides, diminishing to
the end of the tail.

### LIMBS



### FORQUARTERS:


General appearance: Well placed under the body with the elbows
close to the chest.


FCI-St. N° 224 / 17.05.2016
Shoulder: Shoulder blade long, sloping and well laid back, close to
the body.
Upper arm: Sloping backwards, forming a good angle with the
shoulder. The length of the upper arm is slightly less than the length
of the shoulder blade.
Elbow: Close to the body.
Forearm: Straight and parallel. Strong bone.
Carpus (Wrist): Strong.
Metacarpus (Pastern): Powerful and slightly sloping.
Forefeet: Round or oval with tight, arched, strong toes and solid
pads. Feet neither turning in nor out.

### HINDQUARTERS:


General appearance: Well developed, so broad and well muscled.
Seen from behind, straight and parallel. Strong bone.
Thigh: Broad and muscled. Forming a good angle with the lower
thigh.

wide in trotting, without any swinging sideways; neither elbows nor
hocks turned in nor out, inclined to single tracking when speeding.

SKIN: Tight without wrinkles or folds.

### COAT:


Hair: Dense, well covering the body. Not curly-haired, but more a
straight coat with water resistance undercoat. The coat is not really


FCI-St. N° 224 / 17.05.2016
long, but because it’s longer in some places, it gives the impression
of being long. On the neck and the forechest the hair is longer.
The base and the outer edge of the ears covered with long, preferably
wavy, not curly hair. At the tip of the ears, the fur is short, while the
ear on the inside edge is also feathered. On the back until the tailset,
a wavy coat is preferable. Apart from the root, the tail is richly
covered on all sides with long hair, gradually shorter to the tip. The
backside of the fore- and hindlegs and the trousers are feathered. The
feet between the toes are well covered with hair.

Colour: White with brown markings, with or without spots or
ticking. The roan colour is not permitted (mixture of brown and
white hairs all over the body). Less desired is a mantle. Ears are
brown, just like the hair around the eyes.

### SIZE AND WEIGHT:


Height at the withers:   Males: 58-63 cm
Females: 55-60 cm
Weight:

Males: 30-35 kg
Females: 25-31kg
The height at the withers can deviate a few centimeters more, if the
dog is well proportioned.

### FAULTS:


Any departure from the foregoing points should be considered a fault
and the seriousness with which the fault should be regarded should
be in exact proportion to its degree and its effect upon the health and
welfare of the dog.
