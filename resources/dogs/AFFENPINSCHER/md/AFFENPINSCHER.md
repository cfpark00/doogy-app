type.

Without working trial.

BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: Originally used as a
housedog in the region of Southern Germany. His ancestors were
depicted by Albrecht Dürer (1471 – 1528) in his woodcuts. First
entries of Affenpinscher go back to the year 1879. These Toy dogs
were very popular around the turn of the century, they evolved from
the rough coated Pinschers. The harsh ring of hair around the head
emphasised the monkey-like expression. The colours ranged from
self coloured yellowish, reddish, or grey-white to dark grey, blackgrey, and pure black.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: The Affenpinscher is rough haired,
small, and compact with a monkey-like expression.

### IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS:

The ratio of length to height shall make his build appear as
square as possible.




FCI-St. N°186 / 02.09.2009
BEHAVIOUR/TEMPERAMENT: Fearless, alert, persistent and
devoted, sometimes full of quick-tempered passion. He is an
agreeable family dog in all aspects.

### HEAD



### CRANIAL REGION


Skull: Round rather than elongated, altogether not too heavy, high
domed with pronounced forehead.
Stop: Clearly defined.

### FACIAL REGION



Nose: Noseleather round, full, and black. Well opened nostrils.
Muzzle: Short and straight, not curved upwards. Bridge of nose
straight
Lips Tight-fitting to the jaws. Lips are black.
Jaws/Teeth: Complete (42 teeth) set of pure white teeth.  The lower
jaw protrudes beyond the upper jaw and is slightly turned upwards.
The incisors in a healthy mouth are set as regularly as possible in a
slightly rounded row. The canines and the incisors must not be
visible when the mouth is closed, neither must the Affenpinscher
show his tongue when the mouth is closed.  The lack of two of the
PM1, PM2 or PM3, or a combination of two of these teeth is
tolerated.

EYES:  Dark, rather round and full. Black pigmented, close fitting
eyelids, framed by a circle of harsh hair.

EARS: Set on high, carried evenly, turned forward. V-shaped, the
inner edges lying close to the head. Prick ears should be small,
evenly erect and carried as upright as possible.

NECK: Straight, strong, rather short with strong set on.  Throat skin
tight fitting without folds.

BODY: Strong, square and compact.
Topline:  Slightly sloping in an almost straight line from the withers
towards the rear.


FCI-St. N°186 / 02.09.2009

Loin: Short and strong. The distance from last rib to hip is short to
make the dog appear compact.

set on.

beyond the level of the elbows.
Underline and belly: Belly moderately tucked up. Underline and

together.
