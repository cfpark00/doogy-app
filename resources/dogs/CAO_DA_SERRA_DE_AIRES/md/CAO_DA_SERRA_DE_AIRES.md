BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: Sheepdog used in the
Alentejo region for herding and watching different kinds of
livestock; sheep, cattle, horses, goats and pigs. An austere and rustic
dog perfectly adapted to the area’s temperature changes and with
great endurance for covering long distances herding livestock
through the Alentejo plains.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: Medium sized dog, medium long
(Sub-longilinear), with appreciable rusticity and sobriety, extremely
agile and swift, with ample and suspended movement. Long hair of
goat-like texture, without undercoat. It has simian-like attitudes and
appearance, which is why it is known in its native region as “monkey
dog”.

IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS: The length of the body is
approximately 10% more than the height at the withers.





St-FCI n°93/30.03.2009

muzzle length is 2/3 of the skull length; the width of the skull is
slightly less than its length.

BEHAVIOUR/TEMPERAMENT: Exceptionally intelligent and
very lively. Very devoted to the shepherd and the herd, it can be
somewhat wary of strangers and vigilant at night. Nowadays it is also
an excellent companion, sporting and guard dog. It is known for its
skilful ability to keep livestock in the pastures and also for searching
stray animals. It is always vigilant and successfully alerts for the
proximity of predators. The breed is extremely devoted to its work
and its shepherd. The work is conducted with joy and pleasure.
