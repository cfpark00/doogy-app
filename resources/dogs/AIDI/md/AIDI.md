BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: The Atlas dog has existed
since time immemorial in the mountains and on the plateaux of
North Africa.  At present it can be found in large numbers in the
Atlas Mountains of Morocco, the country which holds the breed
standard.
The Atlas Mountain Dog is closely linked to the semi-nomadic
pastoral populations of the mountaneous regions and has the clear
role of defending its masters’ tent and belongings as well as
protecting the flocks from wild beasts which might attack them.
There are no sheepdogs in the Atlas region.  The Moroccan dog
which lives in our mountains has never guarded flocks in the
European sense of the world (herding flocks).

GENERAL APPEARANCE: Solid, very hardy dog, noted for its
power and mobility; it is well-muscled, sinewy, strongly built but not
cumbersome and possessing a thick bushy coat which protects it
equally from the sun and from the cold of its native mountains.


FCI-St. N° 247 / 05.05.2003
This fleece provides a protective armour in the fights which the Atlas
dog has to undertake against jackals and other predators.
It has a lively, direct and decided gaze as befits an alert dog always
ready to fulfil its guarding role.  In some regions of Marocco it is
customary to crop the ears and even dock the tail of working dogs.

### IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS:


•
Length of body (point of shoulder-point
of buttock) / size (height at withers)
10 : 9
•
Depth of chest / size (height at withers)   1 : 2
•
Length of muzzle / length of head
11 : 24
•
Length of skull / breadth of skull
1 : 1

BEHAVIOUR / TEMPERAMENT: Very faithful, affectionate and
docile with its owner and family members, the Atlas Dog displays
inherent guarding and remarkable protective behaviour.  Always
alert, it instinctively measures the gravity and proximity of any
danger and fearlessly provides an appropriate and efficient response.

HEAD: A strong, broad head, well-proportioned in relation to the
whole body, its general shape is conical; the head is free from
wrinkles and has no prominent muscles; the cheek-bones are not
chiselled and link the skull to the muzzle on the same plane without a
break.

### CRANIAL REGION:


Skull: The skull is flat and broad; a slight frontal groove appears and
the occipital protuberance, although present, is scarcely perceptible.
Stop: Only slightly pronounced.

### FACIAL REGION:


Nose: Black or brown in harmony with coat colour, it is reasonably
broad with open nostrils.
Muzzle: Conical like the rest of the head; it is appreciably less long
than the skull; the stop is sloping and not very defined.
Lips: Thin, tight, black or brown according to coat colour.
Jaws: Strong, armed with well-set, powerful, white, regular teeth.


FCI-St. N° 247 / 05.05.2003
Teeth: The bite is pincer (edge to edge incisors).  Scissor-bite or
reverse scissor-bite without loss of contact between the incisors is
tolerated.

EYES: Moderate size, dark shade, varying with the coat colour, from
dark amber to golden brown.  Slightly oblique and well-pigmented,
the eye-lids appear painted on light-coloured coats.  The gaze is very
alert, attentive and scrutinising.

EARS:  Medium length with slightly rounded tips, the ears are set
obliquely so as to leave the skull clear; they are carried half-dropped,
raised forward when alert and sometimes carried back when in
repose.

NECK: Powerful, well-muscled, without dewlap.

### BODY:


Topline: The topline must show a slightly dipping profile, without
being sway-backed.
Back: Broad, well-muscled back of reasonable length, followed by
powerful, very muscled and slightly arching loin.
Croup: Harmoniously sloping.
Chest: Adequate width, long and well let-down, reaching at least as
far as the elbows, slightly rounded rib cage.
Underline: Rising behind the false ribs without being whippety.

TAIL: Long, reaching at least to the hocks, it is set on the extension
of the line of croup, carried low, scimitar fashion in repose.  The tail
is very bushy and the richness of the plume denotes pure breeding.
On the move, the dog carries its tail much more gaily.  The tail
should never be permanently carried curled over the back.

### LIMBS



### FOREQUARTERS:


Shoulder: Oblique, withers distinctly defined, scapulo-humeral angle
of about 100 degrees.
Upper arm: Strong upper arm, muscled, oblique and close to chest.


FCI-St. N° 247 / 05.05.2003
Forearm: Straight forearm, solidly constructed and moderately wellmuscled.
Metacarpus (pasterns): Short and almost vertical.
Forefeet: Practically round, with solid pads and strong nails whose
colour depends upon coat colour.

### HINDQUARTERS:


Hips and thighs: The iliac wing is very pronounced, the thighs are
well-muscled without being overloaded and quite well let-down.
Lower thighs: The angles at stifle and hock are obtuse, which raises
the croup and gives this dipping appearance towards the withers.
Hind feet: Practically round with solid pads and strong nails whose
colour depends upon the coat colour.

### GAIT / MOVEMENT:


Walk, trot, gallop: no hackney action and with sufficient reach.
Natural gait: Short, fast trot, single-tracking.  At this pace the Atlas
Dog seems tireless.

SKIN: Supple and resistant.

### COAT


Hair: Thick, rather harsh, half-long, about 6 cm long apart from on
the face and ears where it is short and finer.  On the neck and under
the throat, it forms a mane, especially in males.  The breeches and
tail are covered with well-furnished and very long hairs.

Colour: The coat colour is very variable.
•
Fawn: From washed sand to deep red.  These coats can be
brindled, with black overlay or carrying a mantle of any hue.
This mantle can be widely spread.
•
Brown: From beige to burned bread shade.  The lightest
tones can have a deeper brown mantle.
•
Black.
All these coats can be spotted with white, the spots can go from a
few discreet marks to a complete covering (white coat).


FCI-St. N° 247 / 05.05.2003
The lips and nose must always be strongly pigmented black or brown
(depending on coat colour).
Harlequin, blue, isabella are not acceptable.

SIZE: 52 - 62 cm.

considered a fault and the seriousness with which the fault should be
regarded should be in exact proportion to its degree and its effect
upon the health and welfare of the dog.
