BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: The first Afghans arrived in
Britain in the early 1900s and one, called Zardin, won in spectacular
style at the 1907 Crystal Palace show in London. The breed is also
known as the Tazi, supporting its resemblance to a Russian breed of
that name. One of the typical sighthounds of the world, the Afghan -
who, as his name implies, comes from the mountains of Afghanistan
- is a hunter and will chase if given opportunity. Nowadays also a
glamorous show dog which must combine strength and dignity with
a long, silky coat as well as having an Oriental expression.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: Gives the impression of strength and
dignity, combining speed and power. Head held proudly.

BEHAVIOUR AND TEMPERAMENT: Eastern or Oriental
expression is typical of breed. The Afghan looks at and through one.
Dignified and aloof, with a certain keen fierceness.
