BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: Though the Old English
Sheepdogs registry is listed as Britain its actual ancestry is thought to
be from the European Shepherd Dogs of the Owtcharka and
Bergamasco types bred to sheepdogs of Britain. It is now regarded as
a native British breed, often called the Bob-Tail. Strong, compact
and profusely coated; his coat is a distinctive feature and is weatherresistant. Basically a country dog, intelligent and friendly; he has a
particularly resonant bark sufficient to frighten off any intruder.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: Strong, square-looking dog of great
symmetry and overall soundness. Absolutely free from legginess,
profusely coated all over. A thick-set muscular, able-bodied dog with
a most intelligent expression. The natural outline should not be
artificially changed by scissoring or clipping. Of great stamina,
exhibiting a gently rising topline, and a pear-shaped body when
viewed from above. The gait has a typical roll when ambling or
walking. Bark has a distinctive toned quality.

IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS: Dog standing lower at withers
than loin. Head in proportion to the size of the body. Muzzle
measuring approximately half of the total head length.



St-FCI n°16/05.01.2011

Type and symmetry of greatest importance, and on no account to be
sacrified to size alone.

FAULTS: Any departure from the foregoing points should be
considered a fault and the seriousness with which the fault should be
regarded should be in exact proportion to its degree and its effect
upon the health and welfare of the dog and on its ability to perform
its traditional work.
