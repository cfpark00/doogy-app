BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: The ancestry of the South
Russian Shepherd Dog is historically thought to be from bearded
coarse-haired dogs which were brought together with fine-wool
sheeps to steppe regions of the South from Spain. This fact is
mentioned in the XXVI volume (1830 y., St.-Petersburg) of
complete collection of the Russian Empire laws.
These agile dogs of medium size, looking like modern Gos d’Atura
Catala dogs, were able to round up the flocks of sheep and to protect
them. These dogs brought from Spain spontaneously mated with
local shepherd and sighthound -like dogs, who had being kept there
sheep from ancient times.
Later these cross-breed dogs became widespread in the southern
regions of Russia and even were known abroad, in Western
countries or Europe as “Russian shepherd”. In 1867, a golden medal
was awarded to the Russian Shepherd Dog at the World's fair in
Paris for the beauty.
However the real selection began in 1898, in the Crimea, in Askania
– Nova, the demesne of Russian baron of a German origin Mr.
Friedrich von Falz-Fein. He was the person to give the breed
modern typical features and to call it “South-Russian Shepherd”.



FCI-St. N° 326/ 12.12.2017
Numerous breeding with local sighthounds had led to increasing the
height and dominance of the white colour, added some lightness of
confirmation and a few flattened chest typical for fast running dogs,
as well as tucked-up belly and more pronounced hindquarters
angulations.
Last typical characteristics of conformation and the name “SouthRussian Shepherd” were finally assigned to the breed in the USSR
period in the early 1930s when the first official standard of the breed
was approved.
The South Russian Shepherd Dogs are easy to keep and they can
easily be adapted to various climatic conditions due to their
endurance, and they are always ready to protect their owners and
their property. These dogs are exceptionally loyal and dedicated to
their owners but at the same time one should not expect that the
South Russian Shepherd Dog will be friendly with the strangers.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: The South Russian Shepherd Dog is
the dog of an above-medium to a large size, moderately long bodied,
not stocky, with strong bones and dry powerful muscles.
The sexual dimorphism is well-defined, the males are more massive
compared to the females and have larger heads. The topline is a
characteristic feature of the breed; it forms a slight curve over the
loin.
The body, head, limbs and tail are covered with coarse, long, thick
and shaggy coat which creates a deceptive impression of clumsiness
and heaviness but in fact the South Russian Shepherd Dog is a quick
and agile dog.

withers. Females are slightly longer than males.
•
The length of the head is approximately 40 % of the height at
the withers.
•
The ratio between the length of the muzzle and the length of the
skull is approximately 5:6;
•
The height at elbows is slightly exceeds half of the height at the
withers.
