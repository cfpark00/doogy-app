BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: Primitive type dog, it
probably originates from the ancient dogs brought by the
Phoenicians and Romans to the Iberian Peninsula in the Classic
Antiquity. It was subsequently influenced by the introduction of
dogs accompanying the Moors in their invasions in the 8th century. It
adapted to the Portuguese terrain and climate, to become what is
nowadays known as the Portuguese Warren Hound. It evolved
morphologically throughout the centuries due to its functionality,
with the small variety being selected, from the 15th century on, as a
ratter on the Caravels of the Portuguese navigators.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: Quadrangular pyramidal head, with
erect ears, sickle shaped tail, well proportioned, with sound
construction and well muscled; very lively and intelligent; sober and
rustic. It exists in three sizes, with two varieties of coat: smooth and
wire.
