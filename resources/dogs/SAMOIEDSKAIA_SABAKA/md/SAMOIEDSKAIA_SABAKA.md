ORIGIN: Northern Russia and Siberia.

PATRONAGE: Nordic Kennel Union (NKU).

### DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THE OFFICIAL VALID



### STANDARD: 04.09.2019.



UTILIZATION: Sledge- and companion dog.

### FCI-CLASSIFICATION:


Group 5 Spitz and primitive types.

Section 1 Nordic sledge dogs.

Without working trial.

BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY:  The name Samoyed derives
from the Samoyed Tribes in Northern Russia and Siberia.  In
Southern parts of the area they used white, black and brown particoloured dogs as reindeer herders; in the northern parts the dogs
were pure white, had a mild temperament and were used as hunting-
and sledge dogs. The Samoyed dogs lived close to their owners, they
even slept within the shelters and were used as heaters.  The British
zoologist Ernest Kilburn Scott spent three months among Samoyed
Tribes in 1889.  Returning to England he brought with him a brown
male puppy called « Sabarka ».  Later he imported a cream coloured
bitch called « Whitey Petchora » from the western side of the Urals
and a snow white male called « Musti » from Siberia.  These few
dogs and those brought by the explorers are the base for the western
Samoyed.  The first standard was written in England in 1909.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: Medium in size, elegant, a white
Arctic Spitz.  In appearance gives the impression of power,
endurance, charm, suppleness, dignity and self-confidence.
The expression, the so called « Samoyed Smile », is made up of a
combination of eye shape and position, and the slightly curved up
corners of the mouth.  The sex should be clearly stamped.




FCI-St. N° 212 / 07.10.2019
IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS: The length of the body is
approximately 5% more than the height at the withers. The depth of
the body is slightly less than the half of the height at the withers.
The muzzle is approximately as long as the skull.

BEHAVIOUR AND TEMPERAMENT: Friendly, open, alert and
lively. The hunting instinct is very slight.  Never shy nor aggressive.
Very social and cannot be used as guard dog.

### CRANIAL REGION:


Skull: viewed from the front and in profile only slightly convex.
Broadest between the ears. Slightly visible furrow between the eyes.

Muzzle: Strong and deep, approximately as long as the skull,
gradually tapering towards the nose, neither snipey nor heavy and
square.  The bridge of the nose is straight.
Lips: Close fitting, black and rather full.  The corners of the mouth

Jaws/Teeth: Regular and complete scissor bite.  The teeth and the
jaws are strong.  Normal dentition.

EYES: Dark brown in colour, well-set in the sockets, placed rather
apart, somewhat slanting and almond-shaped.  The expression is
« smiling », kind, alert and intelligent.  The eyerims are black.

EARS: Erect, rather small, thick, triangular and slightly rounded at
the tips.  They should be mobile, set high; due to the broad skull well
apart.

### COAT


Hair: Profuse, thick, flexible and dense polar coat.  The Samoyed is a
double coated dog with short, soft and dense undercoat and longer,
harsher and straight outer coat.  The coat should form a ruff around
the neck and shoulders framing the head, especially in males.  On
head and on front of legs, hair is short and smooth; on outside of ears
short, standing off and smooth.  Inside the ears should be well furred.
On back of the thighs the hair forms trousers.  There should be a
protective growth of hair between the toes.  The tail should be
profusely covered with hair.  The coat of the female is often shorter
and softer in texture than that of the male.  The correct coat texture
should always have a special glistening sheen.
