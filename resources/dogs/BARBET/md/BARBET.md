common throughout France, used for hunting waterfowl and
described or mentioned in several works as early as the 16th century.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: Medium proportions, medium size,
characterized by a thick, woolly coat which guarantees efficient
protection against cold and damp.  The coat forms a beard (French
barbe) on the chin, which gave the breed its name (Barbet).

### IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS:


•
The muzzle is slightly shorter than the skull.
•
The length of the body, measured from the point of shoulder
to the point of buttock, is slightly more than the height at the
withers.

BEHAVIOUR/TEMPERAMENT: Even disposition, very attached
to his master, very sociable, loving water even when very cold.
