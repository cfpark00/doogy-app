BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: The dogue de Bordeaux is
one of the most ancient French breeds, probably a descendant of the
Alans and, in particular, the alan vautre of which Gaston Phebus (or
Febus), Count of Foix, wrote in the 14th century, in his Livre de
Chasse that “he holds his bite stronger than three sighthounds”. The
word “dogue” appeared at the end of the 14th century.
In the middle of the 19th century these ancient dogues were hardly
renowned outside the region of Aquitaine.  They were used for
hunting large game such as boar, for fighting (often codified), for the
guarding of houses and cattle and in the service of butchers.  In 1863
the first French dog show took place in Paris in the Jardin
d’Acclimatation.  The Dogues de Bordeaux were entered under their
present name.  There have been different types : The Toulouse type,
the Paris type and the Bordeaux type, which is the origin of today’s
Dogue.
The breed, which had suffered greatly during the two world wars, to
the point of being threat ened with extinction after the second world
war, got off to a fresh start in the 1960’s.

President of the SADB), Sylviane Tompousky (President of the
SADB) and Philippe Sérouil (committee member of the SADB).

GENERAL APPEARANCE: Typical concave lined brachycephalic
molossoid.  The Dogue de Bordeaux is a very powerful dog, with a
very muscular body yet retaining a harmonious general outline.    It
is built rather close to the ground, the distance sternum-ground being
slightly less than the depth of the chest.  Stocky, athletic, and
imposing, it has a very dissuasive aspect.

### IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS:


•
The length of the body, measured from the point of the
shoulder to the point of the buttock, is superior to the height
at the withers, in the proportion of 11/10.
•
The depth of the chest is more than half the height at the
withers.
•
The maximum length of the muzzle is equal to one third of
the length of the head.
•
The minimum length of the muzzle is equal to one quarter of
the length of the head.
•
In the male, the perimeter of the skull corresponds more or
less to the height at the withers.


BEHAVIOUR / TEMPERAMENT: An ancient fighting dog, the
Dogue de Bordeaux is gifted for guarding, which it assumes with
vigilance and great courage but without aggressiveness.


FCI-St. N° 116 /  23.01.2009
A good companion, very attached to its master and very affectionate.
Calm balanced with a high stimulus threshold.
The male normally has a dominant character.

HEAD: Voluminous, angular, broad, rather short, trapezoid when
viewed from above and in front.  The longitudinal axes of the skull
out of the bridge of nose are convergent (towards the front).  The
head is furrowed with symmetrical wrinkles, each side of the median
groove.  These deep ropes of wrinkle are mobile depending on
whether the dog is attentive or not. The wrinkle which runs from the
inner corner of the eye to the corner of the mouth is typical.  If
present, the wrinkle running from the outer corner of the eye to either
the corner of the mouth or the dewlap should be discreet.

### CRANIAL REGION:


Skull:
-
In the male: the perimeter of the skull measured at the level
of its greatest width corresponds roughly to the height at the
withers.
-
In bitches: it may be slightly less.
Its volume and shape are the consequences of the very important
development of the temporals, supra-orbital arches, zygomatic arches
and the spacing of the branches of the lower jaw.  The upper region
of the skull is slightly convex from one side to the other.  The frontal
groove is deep, diminishing towards the posterior end of the head.
The forehead dominates the face but does not overhang it.  However
it is still wider than high.
Stop: Very pronounced, almost forming a right angle with the
muzzle (95° to 100°).

### FACIAL REGION:


Nose:  Broad, well opened nostrils, well pigmented according to the
colour of the mask. Upturned nose permissible but not if it is set back
towards the eyes.
Muzzle: Powerful, broad, thick, but not fleshy below the eyes, rather
short, upper profile very slightly concave, with moderately obvious
folds.  Its width hardly decreasing towards the tip of the muzzle,
when viewed from above it has the general shape of a square.


FCI-St. N° 116 /  23.01.2009
In relation to the upper region of the skull, the line of the muzzle
forms a very obtuse angle upwards.  When the head is held
horizontally the tip of the muzzle, truncated, thick and broad at the
base, is in front of a vertical tangent to the anterior face of the nose.
Its perimeter is almost two thirds of that of the head.  Its length
varies between one third and minimum one quarter of the total length
of the head, from the nose to the occipital crest.  The limits stated
(maximum one third and minimum one quarter of the total length of
the head) are permissible but not sought after, the ideal length of the
muzzle being between these two extremes.
Jaws: Jaws powerful, broad.  Undershot (the undershot condition
being a characteristic of the breed).  The back of the lower incisors is
in front of and not in contact with the front face of the upper incisors.
The lower jaw curves upwards.  The chin is well marked and must
neither overlap the upper lip exaggeratedly nor be covered by it.
Teeth:  Strong, particularly the canines.  Lower canines set wide
apart and slightly curved. Incisors well aligned especially in the
lower jaw where they form an apparently straight line.
Lips:  Upper lip thick, moderately pendulous, rectractile.  When
viewed in profile it shows a rounded lower line.  It covers the lower
jaw on the sides.  In front the edge of the upper lip is in contact with
the lower lip, then drops on either side thus forming an inverted wide
V.
Cheeks: Prominent, due to the very strong development of the
muscles.

EYES: Oval, set wide apart.  The space between the two inner
corners of the eyelids is equal to about twice the length of the eye
(eye opening).  Frank expression.  The haw must not be visible.
Colour: hazel to dark brown for a dog with a black mask, lighter
colour tolerated but not sought after in dogs with either a brown
mask or without a mask.

EARS: Relatively small, of a slightly darker colour than the coat.  At
its set on, the front of the base of the ear is slightly raised.
They must fall down, but not hang limply, the front edge being close
to the cheek when the dog is attentive.


FCI-St. N° 116 /  23.01.2009
The tip of the ear is slightly rounded; it must not reach beyond the
eye.  Set rather high, at the level of the upper line of the skull, thus
appearing to accentuate its width even more.

NECK: Very strong, muscular, almost cylindrical. This skin is
supple, ample, and loose.  The average circumference almost equals
that of the head.  It is separated from the head by a slightly
accentuated transversal furrow, slightly curved.  Its upper edge is
slightly convex.  The well-defined dewlap starts at the level of the
throat forming folds down to the chest, without hanging
exaggeratedly.  The neck, very broad at its base, merges smoothly
with the shoulders.

### BODY:


Topline: Well sustained.
Withers:  Well marked.
Back: Broad and muscular.
Loin:  Broad.  Rather short and solid.
Croup: Moderately sloping down to the root of the tail.
Chest: Powerful, long, deep, broad, let down lower than the elbows.
Broad and powerful forechest whose lower line (inter-axillae) is
convex towards the bottom.  Ribs well let down and well sprung but
not barrel shaped.
The circumference of the chest must be between 25 cm to 35 cm
greater than the height at the withers.
Underline and belly: Curved from the deep brisket to the rather
tucked up, firm abdomen, being neither pendulous nor nor too tucked
up.

TAIL:  Very thick at the base.  Its tip preferably reaching the hock
and not below.  Carried low, it is neither broken nor kinked but
supple.  Hanging when the dog is at rest, generally rising by 90° to
120° from that position when the dog is in action, without curving
over the back or being curled.




FCI-St. N° 116 /  23.01.2009


### LIMBS



### FOREQUARTERS:


General appearance: Strong bone structure, legs very muscular.
Shoulders: Powerful, prominent muscles.  Slant of shoulder-blade
medium (about 45° to the horizontal), angle of the scapular-humeral
articulation a little more than 90°.
Upper Arms: Very muscular.
Elbows: In the axis of the body, neither too close to the ribcage nor
turned out.
Forearms:  Viewed from the front, straight or inclining slightly
inwards thus getting closer to the median plane, especially in dogs
with a very broad chest.  Viewed in profile, vertical.
Metacarpus (Pastern): Powerful.  Viewed in profile, slightly sloping.
Viewed from the front sometimes slightly outwards compensating
for the slight inclination of the forearm inwards.
Forefeet: Strong.  Toes tight, nails curved and strong, pads well
developed and supple: the Dogue is well up on his toes despite his
weight.

### HINDQUARTERS:


General appearance: Robust legs with strong bone structure; well
angulated.  When viewed from behind the hindquarters are parallel
and vertical thus giving an impression of power even though the
hindquarters are not quite as broad as the forequarters.
Upper Thigh: Very developed and thick with visible muscles.
Stifle: In a parallel plane to the median plane or very slightly out.
Second thigh: Relatively short, muscled, descending low.
Hock: Short, sinewy, angle of the hock joint moderately open.
Metatarsus (Rear pastern): Robust, no dewclaws.
Hind feet: Slightly longer than the front feet, toes tight.

GAIT / MOVEMENT: Quite supple for a molossoid.  When
walking the movement is free and supple, close to the ground.  Good
drive from the hindquarters, good extension of the forelegs,
especially when trotting, which is the preferred gait.



FCI-St. N° 116 /  23.01.2009
When the trot quickens, the head tends to drop, the topline inclines
towards the front, and the front feet get closer to the median plane
while striding out with a long reaching movement of the front legs.
Canter with rather important vertical movement.  Capable of great
speed over short distances by bolting along close to the ground.

SKIN: Thick and sufficiently loose fitting, without excessive
wrinkles.

### COAT



Hair: Fine, short, and soft to the touch.

Colour: Self-coloured, in all shades of fawn, from mahogany to
isabella.  A good pigmentation is desirable.  Limited white patches
are permissible on the forechest, and the extremities of the limbs.

Mask:
•
Black mask: The mask is often only slightly spread out and
must not invade the cranial region.  There may be slight
black shading on the skull, ears, neck and top of body.  The
nose is black.
•
Brown mask: (used to be called red or bistre).  The nose is
brown; the eyerims and edges of the lips are also brown.
There may be non-invasive brown shading; each hair having
a fawn or sandy zone and a brown zone. In this case the
inclined parts of the body are a paler colour.
•
No mask: The coat is fawn: the skin appears red (also
formerly called “red mask”).  The nose can then be reddish.

SIZE AND WEIGHT: Height should more or less correspond to the
perimeter of the skull.
Height at the withers: For males:    60-68 cm.

For females: 58-66 cm.
1 cm under and 2 cm over will be tolerated.




FCI-St. N° 116 /  23.01.2009
Weight:
Dogs:
at least 50 kg.
Bitches:
at least 45 kg.

Females: Identical characteristics but less pronounced.

FAULTS: Any departure from the foregoing points should be
considered a fault and the seriousness with which the fault should be
regarded should be in exact proportion to its degree and its effect on
the health and welfare of the dog.
