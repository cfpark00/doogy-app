BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: At the end of the thirties,
beginning of the forties of the 19th century, Heinrich Essig, town
Councillor in Leonberg near Stuttgart, crossed a black and white
Newfoundland bitch with a so-called “Barry” male from the
monastery hospice Grand St.Bernhard.  Later a Pyrenean Mountain
Dog was added.  This resulted in very large dogs with predominantly
long, white coats.  Essig’s aim was for a lion-like dog.  The lion is
the heraldic animal of the city of Leonberg.
The first dogs really called “Leonbergers” were born in 1846.  They
combined the excellent qualities of the breeds from which they
stemmed.
Only a short time later, many of these dogs were sold as status
symbols from Leonberg all over the world.  At the end of the 19th
century, the Leonberger was kept in Baden-Württemberg as the
preferred farm dog.  His watch and draft abilities were much praised.
In both World Wars and the needy post war times, the numbers of
breeding stock reduced dramatically.

Today the Leonberger is an excellent family dog which fulfills all the
demands of modern life.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: According to his original purpose, the
Leonberger is a large, strong, muscular yet elegant dog.  He is
distinguished by his balanced build and confident calmness, yet with
quite lively temperament.  Males, in particular,are powerful and

body: 9 to 10.  The depth of chest is nearly 50% of the height at
withers.

BEHAVIOUR / TEMPERAMENT: As a family dog, the
Leonberger is an agreeable partner for present day dwelling and
living conditions, who can be taken anywhere without difficulty and
is distinguished by his marked friendliness towards children.  He is
neither shy, nor aggressive.  As a companion, he is agreeable,
obedient, and fearless in all situations of life.
The following are particular requirements of steady temperament:

•
Willing to be submissive.

the main colour.  A small white patch or stripe on the chest and white
