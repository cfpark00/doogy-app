BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: Posavatz, the scent hound
from the Save Valley is an old hound breed, which descents from a
type of the “Illyrischen Hound of Red Colour with markings”. In the
cemetery chapel next to the village of Beram (Istrien) one can find in
the fresco, dating from 1474, “The bow of the three Kings” a dark
wheaten dog with dropped ears. This was the first portrayal of the
Posavatz Hound. The next portrayal is the altar fresco “The
motherhood of the Holy Virgin Mary” from the 16th century in the
Mother of the Angels Church in Veli Losinj, where the ancestor of
today’s Posavatz Hound is depicted. There is also a description of
this hound in a manuscript from the year 1719 of the Dakovear
Bishop Petar Bakic, where it says, that the breeding of these hounds
was already well known in the 14th century. Franjo Bertic describes
the Posavatz Hound in the year 1854. The FCI published the first
Standard for the Posavatz Hound on April 8th 1955.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: Strong hound-body, medium sized
dog with balanced movements. The characteristic red-wheaten colour
comes in all shades.


FCI-St. N° 154  / 29.05.2015
The white markings are on head, neck, on the fore chest, the chest,
the belly, the lower limbs and at the tip of the tail. The difference
between the genders has to be distinctive.

### IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS:


Rectangular body; length to exceed height at the withers.
Height to the elbow is 50% of the height at the withers.
The length of skull to slightly exceed the length of muzzle.

BEHAVIOUR/TEMPERAMENT: The breed is easy to train. This
is a universal hound with a clear and melodic voice for hunting in all
areas. Docile, neither nervous nor aggressive, reasonably lively
temperament. Very devoted to the owner.

HEAD: The head is well proportioned to the body. The head has
slight divergent lines.

### CRANIAL REGION:


Skull: Slightly longer than the muzzle, it is broadest between the
ears. The temporal area is slightly rounded. The width of the skull
exceeds its depth. The occipital bone and the frontal furrow are
slightly pronounced.
Stop: Well developed but not too exaggerated.

### FACIAL REGION:


Nose: Strong with well-opened nostrils. The whole nose and the
inside of the nostrils have to be black or dark brown pigmented.
Muzzle: Strong, rectangular and full, slightly shorter than the skull,
tapering from the stop towards the nose but not too pointed. The
nasal bridge is straight or slightly convex (slight ram’s nose).
Lips: Average thickness, tight-fitting to the jaw, the labial
commissure is not visible. The liprims are completely pigmented in
correspondence with the colour of the nose leather.
Jaws/Teeth: The jaws are strong, regular and the teeth are white and
evenly placed in the jaws. Scissors bite; the incisors are vertical
placed in the jaws. A complete bite is desired (42 teeth in accordance
with the dental formula). Missing premolars PM1 and molars M3 are
not taken into account. The missing of other teeth is undesirable.

to be fully pigmented in correspondence with the colour of the nose
leather.

EARS: Dropped, close fitting to the head, set at eye level. The ear is
triangular shaped, rounded at the tips, moderately long and
moderately thick. When drawn forward towards the nose they should

be rolled in or sticking out. They are covered with short hair.

Parallel seen from front.
Carpus ( Wrist): Short and elastic.
Metacarpus (Pastern): Elastic, slightly sloping.
Fore feet: Oval shaped with tight toes and strong pads. The nails
should preferably be pigmented.

The movement has to be harmonious; there must be no twitching; the
back has to be preferably steady and the limbs must not cross over.

SKIN: Elastic, of medium thickness, well fitting the body, no
wrinkles.

### COAT


Hair: The hair is harsh, dense, shiny, close lying to the body. The
length is 2–3 cm. On the back of the limbs the hair is slightly longer
(up to 4 cm) also on the belly and on the underside of the tail, where
it forms preferably a “little brush”.


FCI-St. N° 154  / 29.05.2015

Colour: The basic colour of the hair is reddish wheaten in all shades
with white markings on the head, the neck, the fore chest, the chest,
the belly, the underside of the limbs and the tip of the tail. Never a
dark brown or a chocolate brown colour which is not a permitted
colour. The total amount of white markings must not exceed one
third of the whole body. The white should be clear without any
mottling of the basic colour.
Characteristic white markings are placed:
On the head, as a blaze or a stripe (no white on ears).
On the neck, as a collar (complete or partial) or as a stripe.
On the fore chest, a smaller or broader white part.
On the belly, a white stripe.
On the limbs, white parts on the feet, also as socks on
the pasterns.
On the tail, white tip of the tail.
It is desirable that there are white markings on all mentioned parts of
the body and that they are symmetrically spread over the body.
Missing white markings on the mentioned parts of the body are seen
as a fault. White markings are not allowed on any other parts of the
body.

### SIZE:


Height at the withers:     Males: 50–56 cm.
Females: 47–53 cm.
Height difference of +/- 2 cm in males and females of excellent type
and conformation will be tolerated.

FAULTS: Any departure from the foregoing points should be
considered a fault and the seriousness with which the fault should be
regarded should be in exact proportion to its degree and its effect
upon the health and welfare of the dog and its ability to perform its
traditional work.

### DISQUALIFYING FAULTS:
