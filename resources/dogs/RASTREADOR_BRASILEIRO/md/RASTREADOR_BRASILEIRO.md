BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: This breed, contrary to others
originated from interracial crossings, was developed by means of
genetic selection based on the American Foxhound, with the aim of
adjusting its functional characteristics and its adaptation to the
Brazilian climate. The breed was developed by the Brazilian breeder
Osvaldo Aranha Filho, bearing the name of Brazilian Tracker because
of its proven hunting qualities. This breed is the evolution of the old
"URRADOR BRASILEIRO" (Brazilian Howler), with physical
characteristics fitting the life in Brazilian countryside. The breed was
first recognized by FCI on September 1, 1967, suffering a major
setback from the 70s to the year 2000 when its breeding was resumed.
Widely bred in rural areas, mainly in the north of Brazil, the Brazilian
Hound is an important auxiliary to man in his several activities.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: Strong, rustic, cheerful, lively without
being aggressive, he has a privileged sense of smell and ability to hunt.
It is very resistant and persistent, able to run for hours in rough terrain
under high temperatures, without much difficulty. Excellent hunter,
large in size, with smooth coat and long ears.




FCI-St N° 275 / 27.11.2020

IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS: Body length ratio to its height is
10:9. The ratio length of the muzzle to length of the skull is 1:1.

BEHAVIOUR / TEMPERAMENT: Quiet and balanced, attached to
its owner, self-confident, intrepid and docile, without being shy or
aggressive. Because of their work they should behave calmly, since
they hunt in pairs, trios and packs, or even alone as a scent dog.

EYES: Almond-shaped, dark, with lively expression and wellpigmented black eyelid edges. Large eyes placed well apart, with a
typical hound expression. Smooth, gentle and pleasant look.

length, when pulled without effort, reaches the tip of the muzzle,
without exceeding it. Almost lacking in erectile capacity, they hang
close to the head.

substance, but not heavy, moderately long, throat clear, allowing a
slight skin fold under the angle of the jaw, with slight dewlap.
