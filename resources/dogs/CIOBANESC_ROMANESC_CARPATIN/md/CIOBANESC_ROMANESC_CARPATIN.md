BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: The Romanian Carpathian
Shepherd Dog was selected from an endemic breed present in the
Carpathian-Danubian area. For centuries the principle criteria for
selection has been utilization, this dog having conserved its character
intact to the present day.
The first standard was written in 1934 by the Zootechnical National
Institute. This standard was modified and updated in 1982, 1999 and
2001 by the Romanian Kennel Club. The Technical Committee of
the R.K.C. adapted the standard on 30.03.2002 to conform to the
model proposed by the FCI.

chest is large and deep, the shoulder long and slightly sloping.

Sexual dimorphism is well defined; the males should be taller and
stronger than the females.

IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS: The length of the skull is slightly
greater than or equal to half  of the total length of the head). The
length of the body is always greater than the height at the withers. In
females, the lumbar region may be a little longer. The depth of the
