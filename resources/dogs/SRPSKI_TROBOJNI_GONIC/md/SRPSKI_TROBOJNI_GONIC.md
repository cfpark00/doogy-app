BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: The tricoloured scent hound
has the same origins as the other Balkan scent hounds. In 1946 the
theory that this breed was merely a variety of the Serbian scent
hound was refuted; it was granted breed status and a first standard
was drawn up. This breed was shown to cynological circles at the
Belgrade International Dog Show on June 7th and 8th 1950.  The
F.C.I. recognised the breed and published the standard for the
tricoloured Yugoslav scent hound on July 25th, 1961.
