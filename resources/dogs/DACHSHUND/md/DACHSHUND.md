UTILIZATION: Hunting dog, above and below ground.

FCI CLASSIFICATION: Group 4: Dachshunds.
With working trial.

BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: The Dachshund, also called
Dackel or Teckel, has been known since the Middle Ages. From the
Bracken, dogs especially suitable for hunting below ground were
consistently bred. From these short-legged dogs, the Dachshund
evolved and is recognised as one of the most versatile hunting breeds.
He also shows excellent performance above ground, hunting while
giving tongue, flushing and tracking wounded game. The oldest Club
devoted to the breeding of Dachshunds is the “Deutsche Teckelklub”
e.V., founded in 1888.
For decades the Dachshund has been bred in three different sizes
(Teckel, Miniature Teckel and Rabbit Teckel) and in three different
coat varieties (Smooth-haired, Wire-haired and Long-haired),
resulting in nine varieties.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: Low, short legged, elongated but
compact build, very muscular with cheeky, challenging head carriage
and alert facial expression. His build allows agile, quick work above
and below ground. Sexual dimorphism is noticeable.

IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS: With a ground clearance of about
one third of the height at withers, the body length (from the point of
manubrium of sternum to the point of the buttock) should be in
harmonious relation to height at withers, about 1.7 – 1.8 : 1.



FCI-St. N° 148/ 14.03.2022
BEHAVIOUR / TEMPERAMENT: Friendly by nature, neither
fearful nor aggressive, with even temperament. Passionate, persistent
and fast hunting dog with an excellent nose.

HEAD: Elongated as seen from above. As seen in profile, tapering
uniformly towards the nose leather, yet not pointed. Superciliary
ridges clearly defined. Nasal cartilage and bridge of nose long and
narrow.

### CRANIAL REGION:


Skull: Rather flat, not too broad, gradually merging with the slightly
arched nasal bridge. Occipital peak not pronounced much.
Stop: Slightly marked.

definition.
Muzzle: Long, sufficiently broad and strong. Mouth can be opened
wide, at the level of the vertical of the eye.
Lips: Taut fitting, covering the lower jaw well.
Jaws / Teeth: Well-developed jaws. Scissor bite, even and closing
tightly. Ideally, complete set of 42 teeth according to requirements of
the dentition formula with strong canines exactly fitting into each
other.

energetic and yet friendly expression. Not piercing. Colour bright dark
reddish-brown to blackish brown in all coat colours of the dogs. Wall-

### FAULTS:


Any departure from the foregoing points should be considered a fault,
and the seriousness with which the fault should be regarded should be
in exact proportion to its degree and the effect upon the health and
welfare of the dog as well as its ability to perform its traditional work.
M3 (Molar 3) are not to be considered when judging. Lack of two PM1
(Premolar 1) is not to be penalised. The absence of one PM2 should
be regarded as a fault, if no other teeth (with the exception of M3) are
missing. A departure from the correctly closing scissor bite, such as
for example the pincer bite, is also a fault.

### SEVERE FAULTS:


• Weak, long-legged or body trailing on ground.

«disqualifying faults».
