### GAMMEL DANSK HØNSEHUND


(Old Danish Pointing Dog)




FCI-St. N° 281 / 12.10.1998


ORIGIN: Denmark.

### DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THE OFFICIAL VALID



### STANDARD: 08.01.1998.



UTILIZATION: Versatile gundog for birds.

FCI-CLASSIFICATION:  Group  7
Pointing dogs.

Section 1.1 Continental pointing


dogs, « Braque » type.

With working trial.

BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY :  The origin of the breed can
be traced back to the year about 1710 when a man named Morten
Bak, living in Glenstrup near the towns of Randers and Hobro,
through 8 generations was crossing gypsy dogs with local farmdogs
and in this way established a pure breed of piebald white and brown
dogs called  Bakhounds or Old Danish Pointing Dogs.  The local
farmers called their farmdogs « Bloodhounds », but it seems more
likely that these hounds were offspring from the Squire’s scent
hounds, which in their turn were descendants from mainly St. Hubert
Hounds (Bloodhounds).  Likewise it is probable that the gypsy dogs
generally descended from Spanish pointing Dogs and other breeds of
scent hounds like the ones mentioned above, so in many ways
St.Hubert Hounds have contributed to the breed Old Danish Pointing
Dog.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: Medium sized dog, rectangular and
strongly built.  One of the most charming features of the breed is the
great difference between male and female.  While the dog is
powerful and substantial, the bitch is characterized by being lighter,
more spirited and capricious.

IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS: The ratio of height at withers to
length of body is about 8 : 9.



FCI-St. N° 281 / 12.10.1998

BEHAVIOUR/CHARACTER: Conveys the impression of a quiet
and stable dog showing determination and courage.  During the hunt
progressing rather slowly, always maintaining contact with the
hunter and accomplishing its task as a pointing Dog without creating
unnecessary disturbance of the ground.  The breed is suited for small
as well as large hunting grounds.

HEAD: Short and wide, without pronounced stop.  Occiput
prominent and clearly visible from any angle.

### CRANIAL REGION:


Skull: Sufficiently wide and distinctly rounded.
Stop: Not pronounced.

### FACIAL REGION:


Nose: Fleshy, strongly defined, nostrils wide open.  Colour from
dark to more light liver.
Muzzle: Bridge of nose wide.
Lips: Flews deep all the way from the nose and covering  the lower
jaw.  The deep flews contribute to giving the head its characteristic
depth.
Jaws /Teeth: Powerful jaws with regular scissor bite.  Full dentition
wanted.
Cheeks: Well defined and deep, very muscular.

EYES: Medium sized, neither sunk nor prominent.  Dark brown
colour desirable.  Considering the origin of the breed a slight
drooping of the lower eyerim is tolerated, but should not be
encouraged.

EARS: Set rather low, broad and slightly rounded at the ends.
Length is correct if the ear, when held towards the nose, will leave
free a little more than the outer third of muzzle.  Front edge of ear
should hang nicely close to the cheek.

NECK: Muscular and well furnished.  Throatiness is considered a
hallmark of the breed, but should not be exaggerated.
