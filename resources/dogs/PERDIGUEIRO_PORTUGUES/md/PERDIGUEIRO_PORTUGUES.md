Dogs.

With working trial.

BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: The Portuguese Pointing Dog
originates from the Iberian Peninsula, descending from the old
Peninsular Pointing Dog, a common ancestor to other pointing dogs.
It evolved by adapting to the climate, terrain and game and from the
selection imposed by the socio-cultural specificity of the Portuguese,
who have been breeding it for centuries for hunting purposes. The
breed conserved the morphological and functional traits similar to
those existing nowadays.
Its existence in Portugal can be traced back to at least the 12th
century. In the 14th century it was known as the “podengo de
mostra”, already showing the capacity for pointing game. It was bred
in the royal and nobility kennels and used in falconry. In the 16th
century, already named “perdigueiro” (from “perdiz” the common
Portuguese name for partridge), it was frequently used by
commoners.
The definition of the current traits and dissemination by a group of
breeders and hunters began in the first quarter of the 20th century.




FCI-St. N° 187  / 30.03.2009
GENERAL APPEARANCE: Medium sized dog, rectilinear,
bracoïd type, strong but with a harmonious construction combined
with great suppleness of movement.  Seen from the side, the topline
and underline form an elegant outline.


IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS: Square, or almost square body.
The skull to muzzle ratio is 6:4; height at withers to depth of chest is
2:1.

### BEHAVIOUR


/


### TEMPERAMENT:


Extremely
kind
and
affectionate, hardy, capable of great endurance and devotion. Calm
and very sociable, but somewhat haughty towards other dogs.
Curious by nature, works with persistence and vivacity.  Always a
keen hunting dog that stays in close contact with the hunter.

HEAD: In proportion to the size of the body, well built and
harmonious in dimension, it gives the impression of being larger than
it is. Slightly bulky, neither bony nor fleshy. Covered with loose, thin
skin and without wrinkles.
Rectilinear in profile and square when seen from the front.
Convergent longitudinal superior cranium-facial axes.

### CRANIAL REGION:


Skull: Square, almost flat top line when seen from the front and
slightly arched in profile, with a length that should not exceed 6/10
of the total head length, therefore with 60% cephalic index.
Seen from the front the forehead is almost flat, high, wide and
symmetrical, slightly arched in profile. Well developed superciliary
arches. Wide and not very deep frontal furrow. Barely perceptible
occipital protuberance.
Stop: Well defined  (90-100º).

### FACIAL REGION:


Nose: The angle between the nasal bridge and the upper lip is 90°.
Nose of good conformation, well developed with large wet and wide
open nostrils. Black.
Muzzle: Rectilinear and horizontal, adequately broad, with the same
width over its length which is 4/10 of the head length.


FCI-St. N° 187  / 30.03.2009
Lips : Pendulous upper lips, square in profile, at a right angle with
the nasal bridge, semicircular at the tip when seen in profile; seen
from the front, forming a sharp angle in the inferior edge; they join
the lower lips by loose, folded commissures, with drooping corners.
Averagely cut mouth, with irregularly pigmented (mucous)
membranes, should have a normal occlusion allowing normal
overlapping of the upper lip.
Jaws/Teeth: Healthy, correct and full dentition, with scissors bite.
Cheeks: Parallel. Barely perceptible retro-commissural fold, with full
parotid area (i.e. Well filled out under ear).

EYES: Expressive, lively, brown, of a darker colour than the coat;
oval shaped tending to round, biggish but not too big, level set and
filling the orbit. Thin and wide open lids, with black pigmentation.

EARS: Set above the level of the eyes on the rear part of the head,
hanging, almost flat surface with one or two longitudinal folds when
attentive, triangular, much wider at the base than at the tip in a
proportion of 2.5 to 1, and with rounded tip. The length of the ears
should be slightly superior to that of the skull. Thin, smooth, covered
with thin, dense and very short hair.


NECK: Straight, slightly arched in the upper third part, length not
inferior to the head length, not very thick and with a short dewlap in
the throat. It should join the head gracefully at an angle of
approximately 90º and the connection between neck and body should
not be accentuated.

### BODY:


Top line: Rectilinear, rising slightly from croup to withers.
Withers: Not very high.
Back: Short, broad, rectilinear and slightly sloping down to the loin,
to which it joins well.

Loin: Short, very broad, with strong muscles, slightly arched and
well connected to the croup.
Croup: Of proportional width in relation to the loin, of harmonious
conformation with a slightly oblique axis slightly sloping down.


FCI-St. N° 187  / 30.03.2009
Chest: Deep and broad, with good thorax width, more developed in
length and depth than in width, reaching the elbow. Well sprung ribs
in the upper section and very broad.
Considering the girth and in cross-section, the chest and its bordering
ribs appear horseshoe-shaped, with both ends meeting sternum.
Underline and belly: Slightly uprising from sternum to groin. The
slim belly joins the hip in a circumference arch; the distance
separating the hip from the last rib gives the flank a short and well
coupled appearance.

### TAIL:


Natural: of medium length, not reaching below the hock. Straight, of
medium set, thick at the base and slightly tapering to the tip. Well set
in perfect continuity with the line of the croup. At rest it hangs
naturally, but never between the thighs. In motion, it rises
horizontally or slightly above the topline but never vertically or
sickle-shaped. Wagging from side to side.
Docked: in order to cover the genitals without surpassing them.

### LIMBS



### FOREQUARTERS:


General appearance: Straight when seen from the front and perfectly
parallel to the main line of the body. Seen from the sides, upright and
giving an overall appearance of great stability, support and natural
ease of movement.
Shoulder: Long; with medium inclination, well set and quite strongly
muscled. 120º scapula-humerus angle.
Upper arm: Close to the chest. Its length is in accordance with the
shoulder blade and the angulation is proportionate.
Elbow: Separated from the chest by the armpit, clean, well let down,
of equal distance to the main line of the body, neither turned in or
out. 150º humerus-radius angle.
Forearm : Set off from the body, long, straight and perpendicular to
the ground, when seen from front or sides.
Carpus (Pastern joint) : In perfect continuity to the forearm.
Metacarpus (Pastern) : Broad, slightly sloping.


FCI-St. N° 187  / 30.03.2009
Forefeet: Proportional to the size of the limb, tending to be round
rather than long, but without resembling cat-feet. Well formed toes,
tight, uniform and robust to give good support.
Strong and well developed pads, with black, thick, hard and resistant
hide. Strong nails, hard and preferably black.

### HINDQUARTERS:


General appearance: Upright when seen from the back and perfectly
parallel to the main body line, with normal uprightness when seen
from sides.
Thigh: Long, broad, well muscled. Buttocks shaped in a more or less
accentuated curve, long and with a slightly elastic musculature. 95º
hip-femur angle
Stifle joint: Slightly below the belly, but not too far from it. Slightly
prominent and slightly turned out. 120º femur-tibia angle.
Second thigh: Well placed, the length being proportional to the
length of the thigh, its obliquity should be in proportion with the
slope of the croup.
Hock: Sufficiently open and well placed, clean, broad and thick. 145º
tibia-tarsus angle.
Metatarsus (rear pastern): Of medium height, vertical, almost
cylindrical, of even thickness and lean.

Hind feet: Identical to the forefeet, but slightly longer.

GAIT/MOVEMENT: With normal stride, easy and elegant.
Polyvalent in its work and quite adaptable to diverse ground, weather
and game, the movement switches between a simple suspension
gallop and an extended, easy and rhythmic trot.

### COAT


Hair: Short, hard, close, harsh and dense, covering the body evenly,
with the exception of the armpits, groin, perianal and genital regions
where is more sparse and softer. It is thinner and shorter on the head,
especially on the ears, which have a velvety look. Without undercoat.

Colour: Yellow of light, medium and dark shades, solid or with
white patches on the head, neck, chest, lower extremity of limbs,
below the elbows and hocks and tip of tail when undocked.
