St-FCI n°88/23.08.2013

and placement of eyes, correct position and carriage of ears.

Lips: Tight with black rims.
Jaws/Teeth: Jaws level, clean, strong with well-developed underjaw.

on top of skull. In repose, thrown back; when alert brought forward
and carried semi-erect with tips falling forward.

proudly.
