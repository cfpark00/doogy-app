### MASTÍN ESPAÑOL


(Spanish Mastiff)




FCI-St. N° 91  / 30.08.2002

TRANSLATION: Mrs. Peggy Davis.  Official language (ES).

ORIGIN: Spain.

### DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THE OFFICIAL VALID



### STANDARD: 26.05.1982.



UTILIZATION: Guard and defense.  The breed is closely related
to the seasonal moving in the livestock, and especially the Merino
livestock which he already accompanied at the time of the
“Mesta”(association, in the Middle-age, of breeders of the wandering
herds) by defending them from wolves and other predators, all along
their journey from one location to other and on the grazing pastures,
in all seasons and sites.  Actually, he accompanies numerous herds,
whether sedentary or wandering by fulfilling his ancestral task.  He
performs in the same way the function of guard and protection of
farms, people and properties in general.

### FCI-CLASSIFICATION:


Group 2
Pinscher and
Schnauzer- Molossoid
breeds- Swiss Mountain
and Cattle Dogs.

Section 2.2 Molossoid breeds,
Mountain type.

Without working trial.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: It is a dog of great size, hypermetic,
of medium proportions and of sub-long line structure.  Well
balanced, very powerful and muscular. Compact bone structure.
Massive head and a body covered with a semi-long coat.  Most
important are balance and functional harmony in the dog standing as
well on the move.  His bark is raucous, low pitched and deep, very
sonorous, audible from a considerable distance.




FCI-St. N° 91  / 30.08.2002

### IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS:


The length of the body exceeds the height at the withers.  The
relation between the length of the skull and that of the muzzle must
be 3/2.

BEHAVIOUR / TEMPERAMENT: It is a very intelligent dog, not
without beauty, whose expression manifests both these qualities.
Rustic, affectionate, kind and noble, he is very determined when
facing dangerous animals and in front of strangers, especially when
he has the opportunity to defend and protect farms or cattle.  In his
behaviour, one can see it is a dog sure of himself, determining his
strength because he is aware of his enormous power.

HEAD: Big, strong and shaped like a truncated pyramid with broad
basis. The whole of the skull and muzzle, seen from above, must be
square and well linked, without a very marked diminution of width
between the base of the muzzle and the temporal bones.  The faciocranial axes are moderately divergent.

### CRANIAL REGION:


Skull: Broad, strong, profile sub-convex.  The width of the skull
should be equal or superior to its length.  Frontal sinus accentuated.
Occipital crest marked.
Stop: Slightly sloping, not very accentuated.

### FACIAL REGION:


Nose: Black, wet, big and broad.
Muzzle: Straight nasal bridge.  Seen from above, the muzzle appears
moderately rectangular, tapering gradually in width towards the nose,
but still keeping an appreciable width.  In no case it should be
pointed.
Lips: The upper lip largely covering the lower lip; the lower lip with
slak mucous membranes forms a very loose labial commissure.  The
mucous membranes must be black.
Jaws/Teeth: Scissor bite.  Teeth white, solid and sound.  Big, pointed
canines assuring a good hold of prey.


FCI-St. N° 91  / 30.08.2002
Molars solid and powerful. Incisors rather small. All premolars
should be present.  Palate black, with well marked ridges.

EYES: Small in comparison with the skull, almond shaped,
preferably dark, of hazel colour.  The look is attentive, noble, soft
and intelligent, very hard in front of strangers.  Eyelids of thick
tissue, with black pigmentation.  The lower lid allows a part of the
conjunctiva to be seen.

EARS: Of medium size and hanging; triangular shape, flat. Attached
above the eye-line.  At rest, hanging close to the cheeks, without
being too close to the skull.  In attention, they come away from the
cheeks and are partially pricked in the back part of their top third.
They must not be cropt.

NECK: Trunk shaped, broad, solid, muscled, flexible.  Skin thick
and loose.  Double dewlap amply developed.

BODY: Rectangular.  Stocky and robust, showing great power; yet
supple and agile.
Topline: Straight, horizontal including while on the move.
Withers:  Well marked.
Back: Powerful, muscled.
Loin:  Long, broad and powerful; its dimensions decreasing down
towards the flank.
Croup: Broad and solid.  Its inclination to the horizontal is of some
45°.  The height at the croup is equal to the height at the withers.
Chest: Broad, deep, muscled and powerful.  The point of the sternum
marked.  Ribs with wide intercostal spaces, rounded, not flat.  The
minimum thoracic perimeter exceeds by about 1/3 the height at the
withers.
Underline and belly: Belly very moderately tucked-up; the flank let
down and very ample.

TAIL: Very thick at its root and set at medium height.  Solid, supple
and covered with hair longer than that of the rest of the body.  At rest
it is carried low, distinctly reaching the hock; sometimes forms a
curve in its last quarter.


FCI-St. N° 91  / 30.08.2002
When the dog is moving or animated, he will raise it sabre fashion,
with a curve at its tip, but never curved in all its length nor carried
over the croup.

### LIMBS

seen from the front.  The length of the forearm should be the triple of

scapular-humeral angle is near the 100°.

development and covered with hair.

### HINDQUARTERS:


General appearance: Powerful, muscular.  Lateral view : adequate

being the ones most highly thought after providing they are of
harmonious proportions.

77 cm.


for bitches:   72 cm.
It is desirable that these measurements be amply exceeded; the size
in males should be over 80 cm, and in females over 75 cm.

FAULTS: Any departure from the foregoing points should be
considered a fault and the seriousness with which the fault should be
regarded should be in exact proportion to its degree and its effect
upon the health and welfare of the dog.
