BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: The Bergamasco is an ancient
breed of a herd dog widespread across the Italian Alpine and preAlpine regions; a particularly large number of the breed could be
found in the valleys of the Bergamo region where sheep breeding was
carried out on a large scale. The dog was essential in aiding shepherds
driving herds during the seasonal movement between the pastures of
the Alpine regions and plains of the Po Valley. A painting by a famous
artist depicting the breed in the sixteenth century provides evidence of
the ancient origins. The first dogs were registered with the Italian Stud
Book in 1891.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: The Bergamasco shepherd is a
medium-sized dog of rustic appearance with an abundant coat
covering all parts of the body; powerfully constructed but very well
proportioned. Conformation is that of a dog of medium proportions
(mesomorphic) the body is square in outline, with well-balanced
proportions in relation to size and the profiles of the head and body.




FCI-St. N° 194 / 15.09.2020


### IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS:


The length of the body from the point of the scapulo-humeral joint to
point of buttocks is equal to the height at the withers (i.e. square). The
length of the head is 4/10th of the height at the withers. The depth of
chest must be 50% of the height at the withers.

BEHAVIOUR/TEMPERAMENT: The function of the Bergamasco
shepherd dog is to drive and guard herds and livestock in general, a
task for which the breed expresses consummate behaviour thanks to
the vigilance, concentration and harmonious built. The capacity for
learning and the determination combined with moderation and
patience make the dog an excellent guard and companion, suited to
various functions. Known to establish a close relationship with man.
The breed must never be aggressive or fearful, although a slight
natural diffidence is mentioned as a somewhat typical characteristic of
some sheepdogs.

HEAD: Head shape with parallel planes proportionate in relation to
the body. The head is covered with abundant hair, making it appear
large. The length of the muzzle equals that of the skull. The skin must
not be thick but tight without wrinkles.

### CRANIAL REGION:


Skull: Medium sized with top of skull tending towards flat, the upper
longitudinal planes of the skull and the muzzle are parallel. The width
must be less than half the total length of the head. The frontal region
is well developed lengthwise and widthwise. The supercilliary arches
are well defined. The median frontal furrow (metopic suture) is
marked; the occipital crest is well defined and pronounced.
Stop: The stop is evenly sloping, but accentuated due to the marked
bones of the nose and forehead, the frontal protuberances and the
superciliary arches.

### FACIAL REGION:


Nose: In line with the muzzle with curved upper profile, wide open
nostrils, humid, fresh and large. Viewed in profile it must not appear
protruding. The colour of the nose leather is black.


FCI-St. N° 194 / 15.09.2020
Muzzle: Tapers progressively towards the nose with lateral surfaces
converging slightly, so that the muzzle itself is not pointed but
truncated, hence the front face of the muzzle is rather flat. Its length is
the same as that of the skull. Measured at the middle, the width is
approximately half of the muzzles length. The depth of the muzzle
must not be less than half of the muzzles length. The upper profile of
the muzzle is straight and the lower jaw, not the lip, defines the lower
part of the muzzle. Due to this conformation, the lip commissure is not
pendulous. The commissure of the lip joins up with an imaginary
vertical line drawn down from the outer corner of the eye. The lower
profile of the jaw is almost straight.
Lips: Thin and divided under the nose forming a long arc one third of
a circle; they are slightly developed hence only just covering the teeth.
The lip rims are well pigmented.
Jaws/Teeth: Upper and lower jaws well developed; the lower jaw
broad. Teeth are white, complete in number and well developed;
incisors in regular alignment. Scissor bite.
Cheeks: Not very prominent.

EYES: Rather large; neither bulging nor sunken, iris of a darker or
lighter shade of chestnut colour depending on the colour of the coat.
They are set forward looking; expression is soft, serene and attentive.
The shape of the rim of the eyelid is slightly oval and the angle of the
eyelid towards the horizontal is only slightly oblique. The eyelids fit
tightly over the eye, with black-pigmented rims; eyelashes are
particularly long so that they can lift the hair falling from the forehead
over the eyes.

EARS: Semi-drop ears set high, i.e. the last two thirds of the ear
leather is pendant. When the dog is alert, the ear lifts slightly at the
base. Triangular shape. Length is between 11 and 13 cm, width 6.5 to
8 cm.  The base is wide, extending at the back to the point where the
head sets into the neck, while frontally reaching to the middle of the
skull. The tip is slightly rounded.

NECK: Upper profile is slightly convex. The neck is slightly shorter
than the head. The skin is never loose, consequently always without
dewlap.  Hair must be thick.


FCI-St. N° 194 / 15.09.2020


### BODY:


Topline: Straight topline.
Withers: Prominent and long, well defined.
Back: Straight, well muscled and of good width.
Loin: Slightly convex, firmly joining the back and the croup. Loin
decidedly shorter than the back (measured from the loin to the
withers). The width of the loin is nearly the same as its length; muscles
of the whole region are well developed.
Croup: Broad, strong, well-muscled and slanting, with an inclination
of approximately 30° below the horizontal.
Chest: Must be broad and deep, reaching to the elbows.
Underline and belly: The lower profile of the belly is only slightly
tucked up. The hollowness in the flanks is minimal.

TAIL: Set on the lower third of the croup, thick and strong at the root,
it gradually tapers towards the tip. Covered with slightly wavy goatlike hair. Length of tail often reaches the hock when the dog is
standing; preferably it should be shorter. At rest the tail is carried sabre
fashion i.e. pendant in the top two thirds, with the end third slightly
curved. In action the dog waves his tail flag-like laterally.

### LIMBS



### FOREQUARTERS:


General appearance: Legs are straight when viewed from the front and
side and well-proportioned in relation to the size of the dog.
Shoulder: Strong and massive. Long and set obliquely. Muscles must
always be well developed.
Upperarm: Well-muscled, strong in bone and well angulated. The
angle formed by the scapula and upper arm (scapulo-humeral) ranges
between 105° and 125°.
Elbow: Set on a plane parallel to the median plane of the body.  The
point of the elbow is located on an imaginary vertical line lowered
from the back end of the scapula. The humero-radial angle (between
upper-arm and forearm) ranges from 150° to 155°.
The hair hanging down from the elbows should be abundant, long
and thick, tending to flocks.


FCI-St. N° 194 / 15.09.2020
Forearm: Straight; at least as long as the upper arm. Well developed
muscles and bone.
Carpus (Wrist): In a straight line extending from the forearm; mobile
and lean with the pisiform bone clearly protruding.
Metacarpus (Pastern): Lean and mobile.  Seen from the front, must be
placed on the same vertical plane as the forearm. Viewed in profile
has a slight inclination from the back to the front.
Forefeet: Oval shaped, arched with tight toes.  Strong nails, curved and
well pigmented and of dark colour, hard pads.

### HINDQUARTERS:


General Appearance: Hind quarters in proportion to the size of the
dog. Straight limbs seen from behind.
Thigh: Long, broad, well muscled with a slightly convex rear profile.
The coxo-femoral angle (between pelvis and upper thigh) ranges
between 100° and 105°.
Stifle (Knee): Perfectly in line with the limb, neither turned in nor out.
Lower thigh: Strong bone, lean muscles with marked leg groove.
Inclination below the horizontal is about 55°.
Hock joint: The external surface is very broad.  Joint well angulated.
Metatarsus (Rear pastern): Broad, perpendicular to the ground.
Hind feet: Oval shaped, arched with tight toes. Strong nails, curved
and well pigmented, dark in colour, hard pads.

GAIT / MOVEMENT: Free with long steps. The preferred gait is a
rather extended trot, maintained for quite long periods. Due to his
conformation, the dog can easily go into an ordinary gallop, which can
be maintained for a relatively long period of time.

SKIN: Tight and fine all over the body, especially on the ears and
forequarters. Neck without dewlap and head without wrinkles. Colour
of the lip and eye rims must be black.

### COAT


Hair: Very abundant and very long, varies depending on the region of
the body. Rather harsh (similar to goat hair) with wavy flocks on the
front part of the body, while from the middle of the chest region to the
rear it is woolly and forms broad strands of varied length depending


FCI-St. N° 194 / 15.09.2020
on the age of the dog; the woolly coat does not moult and traps the
undercoat which is quite long and soft forming mats of felted hair
which are very protective. The flocks start from the topline falling
down the sides of the body. The hair on the head is less harsh and falls
over the face. The hair on the ears is slightly wavy and soft forming
pointed fringes at the tip. The hair on the limbs must be evenly
distributed all over with soft flocks on the forelegs and matted flock
on the hind legs. The coat is soft in puppies and the flocks begin to
form at 12–15 months. Their length depends on the age hence young
dogs must not be penalised for a coat, which has not yet lengthened.
In old dogs, too thick and long a coat that hampers normal movement
and compromises the dog’s welfare should be avoided. The coat
should be cared for and kept clean; avoiding in particular matted flocks
on the beard, muzzle and ears flaps.

Colour: Solid grey or with grey patches of all possible shades from the
softest of grey to a lighter shade of grey on to black. Tinges of isabella
and light fawn permitted. An all-black coat is allowed providing the
black is really opaque.

### SIZE AND WEIGHT:


Height at the withers:
Males: Ideal height at the withers 60 cm.
Females: Ideal height at the withers 56 cm.
With a tolerance of 2 cm over or under ideal height.

Weight: Males:32 – 38 kg.
Females: 26 –32 kg.


FAULTS: Any departure from the foregoing points should be
considered a fault and the seriousness with which the fault should be
regarded should be in exact proportion to its degree and its effect upon
the health and welfare of the dog and its ability to perform its
traditional work.
