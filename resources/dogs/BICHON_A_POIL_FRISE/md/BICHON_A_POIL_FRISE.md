Section 1 Bichons and related breeds


-1.1 Bichons.

Without working trial.

BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: The Bichon Frisé was
brought to France from Italy during the Renaissance. As it looked
like a very small Barbet, it was given the name of “barbichon” which
was then shortened to “bichon”. In the 17th and 18th centuries, many
renowned painters depicted these little dogs which accompanied
kings, nobles and other noteworthy persons. The breed came back
into fashion under Napoléon III, and it was known at that time as the
“Ténériffe”. It was then popularized, becoming well-liked in both
Belgium and France. It almost disappeared after the two world wars.
It is thanks to the passion of a few French and Belgian breeders that a
population was able to be reconstituted. The first dog, registered in
Belgium, was Pitou, born on 23rd March 1924 and was registered in
the Belgian studbook (LOSH) in 1932. N° 1 in the French studbook
(LOF) was attributed to Ida, a female Bichon Frisé on 18th October


## 1934. The current French name – Bichon à poil frisé – was given in


1978 and was recognized as a Franco-Belgian breed.




FCI-St. N° 215 / 02.09.2016
GENERAL APPEARANCE: A cheerful little dog, with a lively
gait and very loose, white corkscrew-curled hair.  Head carried
proud; the eyes are dark, lively and expressive. The tail is carried
gracefully curved over the back.

IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS: The Bichon Frisé is longer than it
is tall, the length of the body (from the point of the shoulder to the
point of the buttock) is greater than the height at the withers. The
body is rectangular.
The ratio of the length of the skull to the length of the muzzle is 3 to
2.
The depth of the chest is equal to the height measured from the floor
to the elbows.

BEHAVIOUR AND TEMPERAMENT: It is a true companion dog
which can be taken anywhere without trouble. It is neither nervous
nor does it often bark, it is very sociable towards both people and
dogs, even if it does not know them. It has a great capacity to adapt
and is very attached to its masters.

HEAD: In good proportion with the body.  The eyes and nose, being
three easily visible black points on an otherwise white head, should
form an equilateral triangle.

### CRANIAL REGION:


Skull: Rather flat to the touch, although the furnishings make it
appear rounded. The frontal furrow is slightly pronounced. The skull
is longer than the muzzle. It is not as wide as it is long and makes up
3/5 of the length of the head. The superciliary ridges are not too
pronounced.
Stop: Marked, but not too pronounced.


### FACIAL REGION:


Nose: Rounded, black, finely grained and glossy.
Muzzle: Very wide at the base, not becoming much thinner towards
the nose, it forms 2/5 of the length of the head. Straight nose bridge,
neither down-pointing nor up-tilting.


FCI-St. N° 215 / 02.09.2016
Lips: Fine, rather lean, falling only enough to cover the lower lip, but
never heavy or pendulous; they are normally pigmented black up to
the corner. The lower lip must not be heavy, visible or slack. The
corner of the lips is well closed and does not allow the inner side of
the lips to be seen.
Jaws/teeth: The upper and lower jaws are wide, each one with six
evenly set incisors. Scissor bite is preferred; pincer bite is tolerated.
Full dentition is preferred.
Cheeks: Flat.

EYES: Very dark, medium-sized, rather round in shape, neither
almond-shaped nor protruding. They must not be set obliquely. The
pigmentation of the eye rims must be completely black. When the
dog is looking forwards, the whites of the eyes should not be
showing.

EARS: The ears are drooping and are well-furnished with profuse
hair. They are attached above the eye-line, forming an equilateral
triangle, and hang vertically along the cheeks. When they are pulled
forward, the leathers should reach at least the corner of the lips, and
at the most should reach the middle of the muzzle. The ears are
mobile, especially when something catches the dog’s attention.


NECK: Quite long, carried high and proudly. It is round and slim
near the skull, gradually broadening to fit smoothly into the
shoulders. Its length is approximately a third of its body length.
Without dewlap.


### BODY:


Topline: Straight, approximately horizontal up to the base of the tail.
Withers: Quite marked.
Back: Horizontal, well-muscled.
Loin: Wide and well-muscled, slightly arched.
Croup: Wide, slightly rounded, very slightly sloping.


FCI-St. N° 215 / 02.09.2016
Chest: Well-developed, well let down to the elbows, deep brisket, the
floating ribs are well sprung and do not end abruptly, the chest being
rather long.
Underline and belly: The underside of the chest rises slightly towards
the line of the belly, which is moderately tucked up. The flanks are
well tucked up; the skin is fine and not loose.

TAIL: Attached moderately high, slightly below the line of the back,
it is carried raised and gracefully curved in line with the spine,
without being rolled up or docked. The extremity of the tail,
regardless of the hair, does not touch the dog’s back. The tail
furnishings may fall onto the back. The tail must not hang when the
dog is moving.

### LIMBS:



### FOREQUARTERS:


General appearance: Seen from the front, the forelegs are straight.
Moderate bone.
Shoulder: Well laid back.
Upper arm: Forming good angulation with the shoulders.
Elbows: Close to chest.
Forearm: Straight and perpendicular seen from all sides.
Pastern: Short and straight seen from the front, very slightly sloping
seen from the side.
Forefeet: Tight, round and well knuckled up, neither turned inward
nor outwards, the pads must be black and the nails should preferably
be black.


### HINDQUARTERS:


General appearance: The pelvis is broad. The hind legs are well
muscled and seen from behind, they are parallel to each other. They
are vertical.
Thigh: broad and well muscled.
Stifle (knee): Well angulated, neither turning in nor out.
Lower thigh: Approximately the same length as the thigh.
Hock joint: Set low and well marked.


FCI-St. N° 215 / 02.09.2016
Rear pasterns: Lean, without dewclaws.
Hind feet: Tight, round and well knuckled up, neither turned inward
nor outwards, the pads must be black and the nails should preferably
be black.

GAIT/MOVEMENT: Quick-moving, free, covering a lot of ground.
When trotting, the head is carried high, the tail is well curved over
the back. Hind legs have good drive. Parallel tracking.

SKIN: Stretched tight over all the body; dark pigmentation is
preferred; however, it does not influence the colour of the hair. The
scrotum should preferably be black.

### COAT:


Hair: Profuse coat. The hair of the outer coat forms loose spiral curls
(this is the curly structure). The soft and dense undercoat must be
present. The coat is neither flat nor corded, neither woolly, nor
matted.

Colour: Pure white. However, before 12 months of age, the coat can
have the tendency to be slightly beige (champagne), but this tinge
must not cover more than 10% of the dog.

### SIZE AND WEIGHT:


Height at the withers: 25 to 29 cm.
A tolerance of 1 cm taller is accepted for males,
A tolerance of 2 cm lower is accepted for females,
provided that the proportions remain balanced and that the sexual
dimorphism is well marked.
Weight: Approximately 5 kg, in proportion with the size.

### FAULTS:


Any departure from the foregoing points should be considered a
fault, and the seriousness with which the fault should be regarded
should be in exact proportion to its degree and its effect upon the
health and welfare of the dog.
