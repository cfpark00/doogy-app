### NOVA SCOTIA DUCK TOLLING RETRIEVER




FCI-St. N° 312  / 05.02.1999

ORIGIN: Canada.

### DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THE OFFICIAL VALID



### STANDARD: 24.06.1987.



UTILIZATION: The Tolling dog runs, jumps and plays along the
shoreline in full view of a flock of ducks, occasionally disappearing
from sight and then quickly reappearing, aided by the hidden hunter,
who throws small sticks or a ball for the dog.  The dog’s playful
actions arouse the curiosity of the ducks swimming offshore and they
are lured within gunshot range.  The Toller is subsequently sent out
to retrieve the dead or wounded birds.

FCI-CLASSIFICATION:   Group  8 Retrievers-Flushing Dogs-



Water Dogs.
Section 1
Retrievers.
With working trial.

BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY:  The Nova Scotia Duck
Tolling Retriever was developed in Nova Scotia in the early 19th
century to toll (or lure) and retrieve waterfowl.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: The Toller is a medium-sized,
powerful, compact, balanced, well-muscled dog; medium to heavy in
bone, with a high degree of agility, alertness and determination.
Many Tollers have a slightly sad expression until they go to work,
when their aspect changes to intense concentration and excitement.
At work, the dog has a speedy, rushing action, with the head carried
out almost level with the back and heavily-feathered tail in constant
motion.

BEHAVIOUR /TEMPERAMENT: The Toller is highly intelligent,
easy to train and has great endurance.  A strong and able swimmer,
he is a natural and tenacious retriever on land and from water setting
himself for springy action the moment the slightest indication is
given that retrieving is required.



FCI-St. N° 312  / 05.02.1999
His strong retrieving desire and playfulness are qualities essential to
his tolling ability.

HEAD: Clean-cut and slightly wedge-shaped.

### CRANIAL REGION:


Skull: The broad skull is ontly slightly rounded, the occiput not
prominent and the cheeks flat.  A good measurement for an average
male would be 5½ ins.  (14 cm) between the ears, tapering to 1½ ins.
(3.8 cm) at the bridge of the nose.  Length of head is approximately 9
ins.  (23 cm) from nose to occiput, but the head must be in proportion
to body size.
Stop: Moderate.

### FACIAL REGION:


Nose: Tapers from bridge to tip, with nostrils well open.  Colour
should blend with that of the coat or be black.
Muzzle: Tapers in a clean line from stop to nose, with the lower jaw
strong but not prominent.  The underline of the muzzle runs almost
in a straight line from the corner of the lip to the corner of the jawbone with depth at the stop being greater than at the nose.  Hair on
the muzzle is short and fine.
Lips: Fit fairly tightly, forming a gentle curve in profile, with no
heaviness in flews.
Jaws / Teeth: Strong enough to carry a sizeable bird, and softness in
mouth is essential. The correct bite is tight scissors; full dentition is
required.

EYES: Set well apart, almond-shaped, medium sized.  Colour amber
to brown.  Expression is friendly, alert and intelligent.  Flesh around
the eyes should be the same colour as the lips.

EARS: Triangular, of medium size, set high and well back on the
skull, with the base held very slightly erect, well feathered at the
back of the fold, hair short at the rounded tips.

NECK: Strongly muscled and well set on, of medium length, with
no indication of throatiness.

Topline: Level.
Back: Short and straight.
Loin: Strong and muscular.
Chest: Deep, brisket reaching to the elbows. Ribs well sprung,
neither barrel-shaped nor flat.
Underline and belly: Tuck-up moderate.

TAIL: Following the natural very slight slope of the croup, broad at
the base, luxuriant and heavily feathered, with the last vertebra
reaching at least to the hock.  The tail may be carried below the level

FCI-St. N° 312  / 05.02.1999

GAIT/MOVEMENT:  The Toller combines an impression of power
with a springy, jaunty gait, showing good reach in front and a strong
driving rear.
Feet should turn neither in nor out and the legs travel in a straight
line.  As speed increases, the dog should single-track, with the
topline remaining level.

### COAT


Hair: The Toller was bred to retrieve from icy waters and must have
a water-repellent double coat of medium length and softness with a
softer, dense undercoat.  The coat may have a slight wave on the
back, but is otherwise straight.  Some winter coats may form a long,
loose curl at the throat. Featherings are soft at the throat, behind the
ears and at the back of the thighs, and forelegs are moderately
feathered.

Colour: Colour is various shades of red or orange with lighter
featherings and underside of tail, and usually at least one of the
following white markings : tip of tail, feet (not extending beyond the
pasterns), chest and blaze.  A dog of otherwise high quality is not to
be penalized for lack of white.  The pigment of the nose, lips, and
eye rims to be flesh-coloured, blending with coat, or black.
