Terriers.

Section  1

BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: For many years, great
controversy existed in the ranks of the terrier fanciers over a type of
terrier called somewhat vaguely ‘the Jack Russell’. Applications
were received by the Kennel Club from a considerable number of
devotees of a strain of Fox Terriers bred by a Victorian hunting
parson, the Reverend John Russell. Eventually this robust and
workmanlike type of terrier was recognised and given the breed
name – Parson Russell Terrier.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: Workmanlike, active and agile,
without exaggeration. Built for stamina and endurance, overall
picture of balance and flexibility. Honourable scars permissible.

IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS: Well balanced. Overall length
from point of shoulder to point of buttock slightly longer than height
from withers to ground. Length from nose to stop slightly shorter
than from stop to occiput.

BEHAVIOUR AND TEMPERAMENT: Originally a terrier bred
to work fox, a confident, energetic and happy dog that has the ability
and conformation to go to ground. Bold and friendly.

colour is acceptable.

Most importantly soundness and balance should be maintained
whilst taking into account that this terrier, bred to work fox, should
be capable of being spanned behind the shoulders by average sized
hands.

FAULTS: Any departure from the foregoing points should be
considered a fault and the seriousness with which the fault should be
regarded should be in exact proportion to its degree and its effect
upon the health and welfare of the dog and on its ability to perform
its traditional work.

### DISQUALIFYING FAULTS:


•
Aggressive or overly shy.
•
Any
dog
clearly
showing
physical
or
behavioural

### N.B.


•
Male animals should have two apparently normal testicles fully
descended into the scrotum (this expression is obligatory in every
standard).
•
Only functionally and clinically healthy dogs, with breed typical
conformation should be used for breeding.
