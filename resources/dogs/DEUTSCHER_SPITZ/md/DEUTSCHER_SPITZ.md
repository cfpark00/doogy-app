## 1. GERMAN WOLFSSPITZ / KEESHOND




FCI-St. N° 97/ 20.09.2024
BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: German Spitz dogs are
descendants of the stoneage «Peat Dogs» (Torfhunde) «Canis
familiaris palustris Rütimeyer» and the later Lake Dwelling Spitz
(Pfahlbauspitz); it is the oldest breed of dog in Central Europe.
Numerous other breeds have been developed from them. In nonGerman speaking countries Wolfsspitz dogs are known as Keeshonds.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: Spitz breeds are captivating on
account of their beautiful coats, made to stand off by plentiful
undercoat. Particularly impressive are the strong, mane-like collar
round the neck (ruff) and the bushy tail carried boldly over the back.
The foxy head with alert eyes and the small pointed, closely set ears
give the Spitz its unique characteristic, cheeky appearance.

IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS: The ratio of height at withers to
body length is 1 : 1. The ratio length of the muzzle to length of the
skull is approximately 2 : 3.

### BEHAVIOUR


AND


### CHARACTER:


The
German
Wolfsspitz/Keeshond is always attentive, lively and extraordinarily
attached to its owner. It is very teachable and easy to train. Its natural
distrust of strangers and lack of hunting instinct make it the ideal
companion and family dog and watch dog for home and farm. It is
neither timid nor aggressive. Indifference to weather, robustness and
longevity are its most outstanding attributes.

### HEAD:



CRANIAL REGION: The Spitz’s medium-sized head, seen from
above, appears broadest at the back and tapers wedge-shaped to the tip
of the nose.
Stop: Moderate to marked, never abrupt.

### FACIAL REGION:


Nose: The nose is round, small and pure black.
Muzzle: The muzzle is not overlong and stands in pleasing proportion
to the skull (approximately 2:3).



FCI-St. N° 97/ 20.09.2024

Lips: The lips are not exaggerated, close fitting to the jaws and do not
form any folds to the corner of the mouth. They are completely black.
Jaws/Teeth: The jaws are normally developed and show a complete
scissor bite with 42 teeth, corresponding to the dental formula of the
dog, i. e. the upper incisors closely overlapping the lower ones and set
square to the jaws. Strong canines fitting exactly into each other.
Pincer bite is permissible.
Cheeks: The cheeks are gently rounded, not protruding.

EYES: The eyes are of medium size, almond-shaped, slightly
slanting and dark. The eyelids are black.

EARS: The small ears are set high and relatively close to each other,
triangular pointed; they are always carried upright, stiff at the tips.

NECK: The medium length neck is set broadly on the shoulders,
slightly arched without dewlap and covered by a thick, profuse coat,
forming a large ruff.

### BODY:


Topline: Merges in a gentle curve with the short, straight back. The
bushy, sweeping tail, which partially covers the back, rounds off the
silhouette.
Withers: The high withers drops imperceptibly.
Back: As short as possible, straight, firm.
Loin: Short, broad and strong.
Croup: The croup is broad and short, not falling away.
Chest: The deep chest is well sprung, the forechest well developed.
Underline and belly: The chest reaches back as far as possible; the
belly has only a slight tuck up.

TAIL: The tail is set on high and of medium length. It reaches
upwards and rolls forward over the back, straight from the root. It lies
firmly over the back and is covered with very bushy hair. A double
curl at tip of tail is tolerated.
