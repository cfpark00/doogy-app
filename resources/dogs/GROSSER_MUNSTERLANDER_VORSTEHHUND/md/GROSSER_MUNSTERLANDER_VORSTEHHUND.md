Dogs, “Spaniel type”.

BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: The historical development
of the Large Munsterlander goes back to the white/particolour bird
and hawking dog of the Middle Ages via the Stöberhund and
Wachtelhund to the Pointer of the 19th century.  The Large
Munsterlander as well as the Small Munsterlander and the DeutschLanghaar (German Longhair) belong to the family of the longhaired
German Pointing Dogs, whose planned breeding began towards the
end of the 19th Century.  After the « German Longhair Club »
finally excluded the black colour from breeding in 1909, the « Club
for the pure breeding of the black and white Münsterland Pointers »
(founded in 1919) took over the breeding of the black and white
Longhair.
After incorporating the remainder of these native Longhairs, in
particular from West-Münsterland and lower Saxony, onto a
foundation list, the Club began the planned breeding of the Large
Munsterlander in 1922.
The foundation list comprised 83 dogs.  Descendants of the dogs on
the original list were entered into the stud book for Large
Munsterlander.
