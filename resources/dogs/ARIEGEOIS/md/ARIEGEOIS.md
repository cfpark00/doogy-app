### ARIÉGEOIS


(Ariege-Hound)




FCI-St. N° 20  / 03.09.1996
TRANSLATION: Mrs Peggy Davis. Official language (FR).

ORIGIN: France.

### DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THE OFFICIAL VALID



### STANDARD: 24.01.1996.



UTILIZATION: Scenthound used for driving game to waiting
guns and for coursing.  His medium size and lightness make him a
precious auxiliary, whether he hunts on his own or in a pack, capable
of evolving easily on difficult terrains.  Hare hunting is his favourite
type of hunting; but he is also used in tracking roe deer or wild boar..

### FCI-CLASSIFICATION:


Group 6  Scenthounds, and



related breeds.

Section 1.2 Medium sized Hounds.

BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: Originates from the Ariège,
product of a crossing of a Briquet with a “chien d’ordre” (scenthound
hunting in a pack) which could have been the Bleu de Gascogne or
the Gascon Saintongeois.  Physically he has kept the typical
characteristics of the “chien d’ordre”, with, however, less distinction,
less size and more lightness.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: Light dog, medium size, elegant and
distinguished.

### BEHAVIOUR / TEMPERAMENT:


Behaviour: From his origins he is hardworking dog being at the same
time very good at driving game to the waiting guns and showing
proof of much initiative and enterprise.  He has a resounding voice
and is quick in his plotting.
Character: Happy and sociable; easy to train.
