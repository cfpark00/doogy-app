### GRAND BASSET GRIFFON VENDEEN




FCI-St. N° 33 / 14.02.2001
TRANSLATION: John Miller and Raymond Triquet.  Official
language (FR).

ORIGIN: France.

### DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THE OFFICIAL VALID



### STANDARD: 09.01.1999.



UTILIZATION: It is the perfect assistant for the hunter with a gun
in territories of moderate size. Fastest of all the scenthound bassets,
tenacious, courageous, and a little stubborn.  It must, from an early
age, be accustomed to obeying; its training implies will and
punishment, for which he will bear no grudge.

### FCI-CLASSIFICATION:


Group 6
Scenthounds and related



breeds.



Section 1.3 Small-sized Hounds. With

working trial.

BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: The Grand Basset Griffon
Vendéen is derived, like all bassets, from hounds of superior size, in
this case the Grand Griffon.  The first selections were made at the
end of the 19th century by the Comte d’Elva who was looking for
subjects with « straight legs ».  But it was Paul Dezamy who was
especially responsible for fixing the type.  He understood that in
order to catch a hare, dogs of a certain size were needed.  He fixed
that size at about 43 cm.  Today used primarily when hunting with a
gun, it is capable of hunting all furry game, from the rabbit to wild
boar.  A team of Grand Bassets won the 5th edition of the European
Cup for hare.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: Slightly elongated overall, it has
straight forelegs, the structure of a basset, and must not resemble a
small Briquet.  It is balanced and elegant.




FCI-St. N° 33 / 14.02.2001

bramble and scrub.

up to the master to take command.

chiselled below the eyes.  Occipital bone well developed.

very slightly convex.

front of the muzzle a square profile.  They are well covered with
moustaches.

intelligent expression.  The conjunctiva must not be apparent.
