UTILISATION: Hunting Dog (Hound) which is able to hunt
independently, also at a great distance from his handler. Excellently
suited to the finding and pursuit of a trail. When he finds a fresh
scent, he yaps with a whining sound; during the hunt giving tongue
to the scent, his barking is resounding, high pitched and ringing. He
drives and points game in an excellent manner. He works smoothly
alone or being part of a brace.

Scent Hounds and Related
Breeds.



Section 1.2. Medium sized Hounds.


With working trial.

BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: The Erdelyi Kopó is an
ancient Hungarian breed, which has been determined by the
peculiarities of the climate, the territory and the hunting conditions.
The breed reached its climax in the Middle Ages, at a time when it
was the favourite hunting dog of the aristocracy. Regarding its
original use, it was pushed back into the path-less woods of the
Carpathian mountains, due to the developments in agriculture and
forestry. As a result of the influence of the various conditions of the
terrain, two varieties of the Erdelyi Kopó evolved: the long legged
and the short legged variety. These two varieties were always kept
together.  Originally the long legged Hungarian Hound was used for
hunting big game like buffaloes and later bears, wild boars and
lynxes, while the short legged Hound was used for hunting small
game like foxes or hares in overgrown terrain and chamois in rocky
areas.



FCI-St. N° 241 /  13.09.2000
At the beginning of the 20th century, the Hungarian Hound was
nearly extinct. The determined breeding was resumed in 1968.
Nowadays a significant number of dogs of the long legged variety
exists in Hungary and in the neighbouring Romania; the short legged
variety disappeared.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: The shape and the carriage of the head,
the body proportions, the strong muscular limbs and the tail set of the
Hungarian Hound correspond to the characteristics of the MidEuropean type of Hounds. It is medium sized. The body formation of
the Hungarian Hound has adapted to the work over long distances. He
is athletically built, neither coarse nor fine boned.

### IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS:


•
The ratio of the length of the skull to the length of the muzzle is
approximately 1:1.
•
The ratio of the height at the withers to the length of the body is
10:11.

BEHAVIOUR / TEMPERAMENT: Good-natured, courageous,
enduring. The basic character of the Hungarian Hound is quiet, even,
but also determined and lively. He even stands extreme weather
conditions.

HEAD: It is a longish but not pointed Hound head; the difference
between the sexes is distinct.

CRANIAL REGION: The skin on the head is close-fitting and free
of wrinkles.
Skull: Slightly domed. The occiput is not pronounced. The
superciliary ridges are slightly developed.
Stop: Barely pronounced.

### FACIAL REGION:


Nose: The nose is not too bluntly cut off, the colour is black. The
nostrils are mobile and wide.
Muzzle: Bridge of nose straight.


FCI-St. N° 241 /  13.09.2000
Lips: Dry and tight fitting. The colour of the mucous membrane is
black.
Jaws/Teeth: The jaws are strong. The teeth are strong and well
developed. Complete scissor bite, according to the dentition formula.
Cheeks: Rounded, only slightly developed.

EYES: Of medium size, almond shaped, slightly oblique. The colour
is dark brown. The lids are close-fitting to the eyeball.

EARS: Set medium high, not too heavy, hanging closely to the
cheeks without being folded. They widen from the base and then
taper towards the rounded tip. Pulled forwards, the leathers cover the
eyes but normally do not reach further.

NECK: Very muscular, of medium length. The skin forms slight
folds on the throat. A slight dewlap is permitted but not desirable.

BODY: The body has the shape of a prone rectangle.
Topline: Straight.
Withers: Pronounced.
Back: Straight behind the withers with well developed muscles.
Loin: In bitches a slightly longer loin is permitted.
Croup: Slightly sloping.
Chest: The sternum does not protrude. The brisket is broad, long and
not too deep. In cross section, it is oval, nearly rounded, to ensure
easy breathing.
Underline and belly: Belly only slightly tucked up.

TAIL: Set on at medium height, strong. In repose, the lower third of
the tail is curved slightly upwards. It reaches, preferably, one to two
cm beyond the hocks. When excited, the dog carries his tail curved,
yet not curled, over the back. The tail is not docked.

### LIMBS



### FOREQUARTERS:


General appearance: Seen from the front, the front legs are parallel
and, as a result of the broad chest, adequately far apart.


FCI-St. N° 241 /  13.09.2000


Shoulders: Shoulder blade well muscled, adequately long and
moderately sloping.
Elbows: Close-fitting to the ribcage.
Forearm: Straight and symmetric.
Forefeet: Large with well knit, strong, arched toes. The pads are
large, firm and well cushioned. Nails strong and as black as possible.

### HINDQUARTERS:


General appearance: When standing, the hind legs are slightly
overstretched beyond the rear; well muscled.
Upper thigh: Long.
Hocks: Low set.
Metatarsus: Straight and parallel.
Hind feet: Toes well knit and strong. Pads large, firm and well
cushioned. Nails strong and as black as possible. Dewclaws should
be removed.

GAIT/MOVEMENT: The stride is long and ground covering, never
mincing. The trot is ground covering. When at work, his gallop is
extremely enduring.

SKIN: The skin of the Hungarian Hound is medium thick. Especially
in the throat region it is a little loose but never folded. It has a dark
pigment. Bare areas of skin are black.

### COAT


Hair: The whole body, even the underside of the belly, is covered by
short, straight, dense, flat coat. On the neck, the withers, the back of
the upper thighs and the underside of the tail, the coat is longer than
on the other parts of the body. Cow-licks and ridges may occur. The
coat is coarse to the touch and shiny.  Undercoat under the topcoat.

Colour: The primary colour of the Hungarian Hound is black. There
is always a not too dark tan point on each eyebrow.
Tan markings on muzzle and legs.



FCI-St. N° 241 /  13.09.2000

The tan is distinctly demarcated from the black. On the nose, a white
marking may occur, possibly extending to a blaze on the forehead, to
a collar around the neck, to the chest, under the chest and to the
lower parts of the legs and the feet. A white marking may also occur
on the tip of the tail. White on more than one fifth of the whole body
is undesirable.

### SIZE AND WEIGHT:


Ideal height at withers: 55 to 65 cm

The decisive criterion is the overall balance rather than the mere
measure in cm.

Weight:
Minimum 25 kg.

FAULTS: Any departure from the foregoing points should be
considered a fault and the seriousness with which the fault should be
regarded should be in exact proportion to its degree and its effect
upon the health and welfare of the dog.

### DISQUALIFYING FAULTS:


• Aggressive or overly shy.
• Any dog clearly showing physical or behavioural abnormalities.
• Cranial or facial region too narrow, too long or rounded.
• Stop very slight or too pronounced.
• Short muzzle.
• Faulty bite.
• Light ears, Terrier or Sighthound like ears.
• Wiry coat, soft, wavy or sparse coat.
• Brown or blue colour with markings.




FCI-St. N° 241 /  13.09.2000

### N.B.:


•
Male animals should have two apparently normal testicles fully
descended into the scrotum.
•
Only functionally and clinically healthy dogs, with breed
typical conformation should be used for breeding.
