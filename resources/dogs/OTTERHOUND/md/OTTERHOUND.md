FCI-St. N° 294 / 27.01.2011
ORIGIN Great Britain.

### DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THE OFFICIAL VALID



### STANDARD: 13.10.2010.



UTILIZATION: Big, strong hound primarily built for long day’s
work in water, but able to gallop on land.

FCI-CLASSIFICATION:  Group
Scenthounds and related



breeds.

Section 1.1 Large-sized hounds.

Without working trial.

BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: It is generally felt that the
Otterhounds ancestry includes a French influence combined with
original English hound strains.
He is a kindly fellow with a typical loud baying call which he can
use to good effect when he needs to indicate that he has found a prey
that interests him, though today his primary purpose of hunting otters
is banned. The breed has keen scenting ability. When following the
scent of an otter on land the scent is called a drag and in water a
wash. An Otterhound can follow a drag for up to twelve hours and
when following a wash may swim for five hours. In addition to his
oily coat he has webbed feet.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: Large, straight limbed and sound,
rough-coated with majestic head, strong body and loose, long striding
action. Rough double coat and large feet essential. Free moving.

### IMPORTANT PROPORTION:


Distance from nose end to stop slightly shorter than from stop to
occiput.

BEHAVIOUR AND TEMPERAMENT: Amiable and even
tempered. Signs of aggression or nervousness should be heavily
penalized.




FCI-St. N° 294 / 27.01.2011
HEAD : Clean, very imposing, deep rather than wide, expression
being open and amiable. Whole head except for nose well covered
with rough hair, ending in slight moustache and beard.

### CRANIAL REGION:

slight peak at occiput. No trace of scowl or bulge on forehead.

### FACIAL REGION:


Nose: Good wide nose, wide nostrils.
Muzzle: Strong, deep.
Lips: Plenty of lip and flew, but not exaggerated.
Jaws / Teeth: Jaws strong, large, well placed teeth with perfect,
regular scissor bite, i.e. the upper teeth closely overlapping the lower
teeth and set square to the jaws.
Cheeks: Clean cheekbones.

EYES: Intelligent, moderately deep-set eye; haw showing only
slightly.  Eye colour and rim pigment variable according to coat
colour (a blue and tan hound may have hazel eyes). Yellow eye
undesirable.

EARS: Unique feature of the breed. Long, pendulous, set on level
with corner of eye; easily reaching nose when pulled forward, with
characteristic fold. Leading edge folding or rolling inwards giving
