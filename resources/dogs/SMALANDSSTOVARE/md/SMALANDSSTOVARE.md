Section 1.2 Medium-sized hounds.

With working trial.

BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: A great variety of scent
hounds existed in the county of Småland during the 19th century.
Some, whose ancestry came from German, Polish and Baltic hounds,
had accompanied soldiers returning to Småland from the great wars
(1611–1718). Those hounds together with local farm dogs of spitz
type with an addition of English hounds became the foundation of
the Smålandsstövare. Size as well as colour varied, as did the length
of tail. Some were black-and-tan, others red or yellow. White
markings were common. Some dogs were born with short tails. In
the early 20th century great efforts were made to re-establish the old
Smålandsstövare, mainly the bobtailed variety, although the first
standard drawn in 1921 allowed both the natural short and long tail.
The standard has been revised several times since. The breed is a
hardy, versatile hound with a good tongue and is mainly used for
hunting fox and hare. It has also traditionally been used for different
small game, but never deer.
