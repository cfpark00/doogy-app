FCI-St. N° 188  / 27.04.1998


TRANSLATION: Mrs. Moreau-Sipiere and Prof. R. Triquet,
brought up to date by Dr. Paschoud.  Official language (FR).

ORIGIN: Morocco.

### DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THE OFFICIAL VALID



### STANDARD: 08.01.1998.



UTILIZATION: Sighthound.

### FCI-CLASSIFICATION:


Group 10 Sighthounds.

Section 3
Short-haired



Sighthounds.

Without working trial, racing licence.

BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: The Sloughi has existed for
many centuries in North Africa.  Nowadays most Sloughis are to be
found in Morocco which is responsible for the standard.  The Sloughi
exists only in a single short-haired variety.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: By demeanour, by delicacy of tissue
and by muscular leanness, his general appearance is that of a very
racy and elegant dog.

IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS: For a male with an ideal size of
27, 5 inches (70 cm), the length of the body from point of shoulders
to point of buttock should be 26-27 inches (67-68 cm).  For a female
with an ideal size of 26 inches (65 cm), the length of the body from
point of shoulders to point of buttock should be 24-25 inches (62-63
cm).
The ratio between length of body (from point of shoulder to point of
buttock) and height at withers should be 0,96 (9,6 : 10).
The ratio between depth of chest and height at withers should be 0,4
(4 :10).



FCI-St. N° 188  / 27.04.1998
The ratio between length of foreface and total length of head should
be 0,5 (1: 2)

BEHAVIOUR / TEMPERAMENT: Although noble and haughty,
he is very attached to his master and defends him in case of need.
With an instinct of hunter, capable of sustained effort, he also
appreciates the home conforts.

HEAD: Seen from the side, the head is longish, refined, delicate but
rather strong.  Seen from above, it has the shape of a very long
wedge, the skull being the widest part, tapering to the tip of the nose.

### CRANIAL REGION:


Skull: Rather broad, seen from aside flat; from one ear to the other
the skull measures 4-6 inches (12 to 14 cm).  The skull is distinctly
rounded at the back and curving harmoniously on the sides.  The
superciliary ridges are scarcely projecting, the frontal groove hardly
marked and the occipital crest and protuberance barely visible.
Stop: Hardly pronounced.

### FACIAL REGION:


Nose: Black.  Strong enough to avoid being pinched. Nostrils well
opened. The nose leather not being held up by a skeletal structure is
very slightly inclined.
Muzzle: It has the shape of a, without exaggeration, elongated wedge
and is perceptibly as long as the skull. The bridge of the nose is
straight from its root.
Lips: Thin and supple, just covering the lower jaw; the corner of the
mouth must be as little visible as possible.
Jaws/Teeth: Teeth normal, jaws strong and regular.  Scissor bite.

EYES: Large, dark, well-set in their sockets, sometimes just covered
by a slight obliquity of the eyelids.  The expression is gentle, a little
sad, the look like nostalgic.  With a light coat, the eye can be ambercoloured.  The eye rims are pigmented.

EARS: Set high slightly above the eye line, drooping, close to the
head, not too large, triangular and slightly rounded at the tips.


FCI-St. N° 188  / 27.04.1998

NECK: Long, well set off from the shoulders and with the topline
(crest) slightly arched.  The length is perceptibly equal to the length
of the head.  The skin is fine, tight, without any dewlap; the hair is
very smooth.

### BODY:


Topline: Gently and harmoniously curved with prominent haunch
bones equal in height or slightly higher than the withers.
Withers: Well projecting.
Back: Short, almost horizontal.
Loin: Short, lean, wide and slightly arched.
Croup: Bony, wide and oblique, but not falling strongly away.
Chest: Not too wide; in depth it hardly reaches the level of the elbow.
Well developed in length.  The ribs are flat.
Underline and Belly: Sternum long and raised, belly and flanks well
tucked up.  The underline is evenly curved, neither abruptly cut up
nor whippety.

TAIL: Thin, lean, set-on in line with the croup and carried below the
line of the back.  It should be, at least, long enough to reach the point
of hocks.  At rest, the tip is forming an accentuated curve.

### LIMBS



### FOREQUARTERS:


General appearance: Forelegs vertical and parallel.
Shoulder: Long and oblique.
Upper arm: Strong.
Forearm: Bony and muscular.

GAIT / MOVEMENT: Walk, trot, gallop.  Gait supple, smooth and
with long strides, covering plenty of ground.

SKIN: Very fine, close fitting to the body, without folds or dewlap.

### SIZE:


Height at the withers:  for males
26-29 inches (66-72 cm),



for females
24-27 inches (61-68 cm).

FAULTS : Any departure from the foregoing points should be
considered a fault and the seriousness with which the fault should be
regarded should be in exact proportion to its degree and its effect
upon the health and welfare of the dog.
• Bad ratio between length of body and height at withers.
• Head and body slightly too heavy.
• Stop too much or insufficiently pronounced.
• Too light-coloured eyes.
