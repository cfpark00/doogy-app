### AUSTRALIAN TERRIER




St-FCI n°8- 05.12.2012

ORIGIN: Australia.

### DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THE OFFICIAL VALID



### STANDARD: 08.10.2012.



UTILIZATION: One of the smallest of the working Terriers, was
bred to be both a helper and companion in rough times and
terrain.

FCI-CLASSIFICATION:  Group   3  Terriers.

Section  2  Small-sized Terriers.

Without working trial.

BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: Although produced from
British ancestors, the Australian Terrier is one of the few breeds
in the terrier group to have been developed outside the United
Kingdom. It can also rightly claim to be the first breed developed
in Australia. It appears reasonably certain that both the
Australian Silky Terrier and Australian Terrier had a common
ancestry from stock in Tasmania, New South Wales and
Victoria, namely the Broken Coated Terriers. It is assumed this
type of dog originated from a mixture of British breeds, namely:
the Skye Terrier, Scottish Terrier (Aberdeen) and the Dandie
Dinmont Terrier.  At intervals the Yorkshire Terrier was
introduced.  It is reported that in the early 1800's free settlers
around Campbelltown and Ross in Tasmania were breeding
broken coated dogs of a blue sheen body colour and tan
markings. They were renowned for their prowess as watchdogs
and weighed about ten pounds.

GENERAL APPEARANCE:  A sturdy low-set dog, rather long in
proportion to height with strong Terrier character, alertness, activity
and soundness.   Its untrimmed, harsh coat with definite ruff around
the neck extending to the breastbone and its long strong head assist
in developing its hard bitten, rugged appearance.
