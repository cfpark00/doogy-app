BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: The Swedish Vallhund is
considered to be an authentic Swedish breed although uncertainty
still exists as to the relationship with the type like the Welsh Corgi.
Whether or not the Vikings brought Corgi-type dogs back from the
British Isles to Sweden or Västgötaspets-like dogs from Sweden to
Britain will never be solved. But modern research believes that the
Västgötaspets is of Swedish origin. Regardless of the breed’s origin,
credit for its recognition goes to Count Björn von Rosen and
headmaster Zetterstén. In the early 1940’s von Rosen was told that
this old type of herding dog still existed and an investigation took
place in the County of West Gotha. Particularly in the planes of Vara
specimens of homogeneous type where found; few in numbers but
enough for Zetterstén to start the breeding. Breed type was well
established without loosing the working ability.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: Small, low on legs and sturdy.
Appearance and expression denote a watchful, alert and energetic
dog.

IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS: Ratio of height at withers to
length of body 2:3. The height from lowest part of chest to ground
