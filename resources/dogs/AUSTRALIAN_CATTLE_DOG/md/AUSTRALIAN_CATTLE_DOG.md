BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: The Australian Cattle Dog
was developed to assist with establishing the cattle industry in
early Australian conditions. The principal requirement was a
strong, biting dog, possessing great stamina and capable of
mustering and moving wild cattle. Early imported breeds of
working dogs did not possess these requirements. The first
settlers had a limited availability of labour, this created problems
in the control of their herds of cattle and flocks of sheep. Most
properties were unfenced and the scrub country had not been
cleared. To facilitate the efficient handling of sheep and cattle,
they set about creating breeds of dogs to do this work for them.
A great deal of research has been undertaken to ascertain the
origin of the Australian Cattle Dog, but as early breeders kept
very little recorded information, there is a marked divergence of
opinion as to the breeds used to develop the purebred dog we see
today. It is generally recognised though, that it resulted from the
crossing of blue merle, smooth haired Collies with the Dingo,
with a later injection of Dalmatian and black and tan Kelpie
blood. Other cross breeding was tried, such as a Bull Terrier
cross, but all these other crosses proved to be unsuccessful for
the working of cattle.




St-FCI n°287- 05.12.2012
GENERAL APPEARANCE: The general appearance is that of a
strong, compact, symmetrically built working dog, with the ability
and willingness to carry out his allotted task however arduous.  Its
combination of substance, power, balance and hard muscular
condition must convey the impression of great agility, strength and
endurance.  Any tendency to grossness or weediness is a serious
fault.

IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS: The length of the body from the
point of the breast bone, in a straight line to the buttocks, is greater
than the height at the withers, as 10 is to 9.

BEHAVIOUR/TEMPERAMENT: The Cattle Dog's loyalty and
protective instincts make it a self-appointed guardian to the
Stockman, his herd and his property. Whilst naturally suspicious of
strangers, must be amenable to handling, particularly in the Show
ring. Any feature of temperament or structure foreign to a working
dog must be regarded as a serious fault.  As the name applies the
dog’s prime function, and one in which he has no peer, is the control
and movement of cattle in both wide open and confined areas.
Always alert, extremely intelligent, watchful, courageous and
trustworthy, with an implicit devotion to duty making it an ideal
working dog.

HEAD: The head is strong and must be in balance with other
proportions of the dog and in keeping with its general conformation.

### CRANIAL REGION:


Skull: The broad skull is slightly curved between the ears.
Stop: The skull flattens to a slight but definite stop.

### FACIAL REGION:


Nose: Black.
Muzzle: Broad and well filled in under the eyes, tapering gradually
to form a medium length, deep, powerful muzzle with the skull and
muzzle on parallel planes.
Lips: Tight and clean.



St-FCI n°287- 05.12.2012
Jaws/Teeth:  Strong, deep and well-developed underjaw. The teeth
should be sound, strong and evenly spaced, gripping with a scissorbite, the lower incisors close behind and just touching the upper.  As
the dog is required to move difficult cattle by heeling or biting, teeth
which are sound and strong are very important.
Cheeks: Muscular, neither coarse nor prominent.

EYES: The eyes should be of oval shape and medium size, neither
prominent nor sunken and must express alertness and intelligence.
Eye colour should be dark brown. A warning or suspicious glint is
characteristic when approached by strangers.

EARS: The ears should be of moderate size, preferably small rather
than large, broad at the base, muscular, pricked and moderately
pointed, neither spoon nor bat eared.  The ears are set wide apart on
the skull, inclining outwards, sensitive in their use and pricked when
alert; the leather should be thick in texture and the inside of the ear
fairly well furnished with hair.

NECK: the neck is extremely strong, muscular and of medium
length broadening to blend into the body and free from throatiness.

### BODY:


Topline: Level.
Back: Strong.
Loin: Broad, strong and muscular.  Dog strongly coupled and with
deep flanks.
Croup: Rather long and sloping.
Chest: Deep, muscular and moderately broad. Ribs well sprung and
carried well back, not barrel ribbed.

TAIL: The set on of the tail is moderately low, following the
contours of the sloping croup and of length to reach approximately to
the hock.  At rest, it should hang in a very slight curve. During
movement or excitement the tail may be raised, but under no
circumstances should any part of the tail be carried past a vertical
line drawn through the root.  The tail should carry a good brush.

### LIMBS



### FOREQUARTERS:


General appearance: The forelegs have strong, round bone, extending
to the feet and should be straight and parallel, viewed from the front.
Shoulder: The shoulders are strong, sloping, muscular and well
angulated to the upper arm and should not be too closely set at the
point of the withers. Although the shoulders are muscular and the
bone is strong, loaded shoulders and heavy fronts will hamper
correct movement and limit working ability.
Metacarpus (Pastern): Pasterns should show flexibility with a slight
angle to the forearm when viewed from the side.
Forefeet: The feet should be round and the toes, short, strong, well
arched and held close together. The pads are hard and deep, and the
nails must be short and strong.

### HINDQUARTERS:


General appearance: The hindquarters are broad, strong and
muscular.  When viewed from behind, the hind legs, from the hocks
to the feet, are straight and placed parallel, neither close nor too wide
apart.
Thighs: Long, broad and well developed.
Stifle (Knee): Well turned.
Hock joint: Strong and well let down.
Hind feet: The feet should be round and the toes, short, strong, well
arched and held close together. The pads are hard and deep, and the
nails must be short and strong.

GAIT/MOVEMENT: The action is true, free, supple and tireless
and the movement of the shoulders and forelegs is in unison with the
powerful thrust of the hindquarters.  The capability of quick and
sudden movement is essential. Soundness is of paramount
importance. When trotting the feet tend to come closer together at the
ground level as speed increases, but when the dog comes to rest he
should stand four square.




St-FCI n°287- 05.12.2012

### COAT



Hair: The coat is smooth, a double coat with a short, dense
undercoat.  The outer coat is close, each hair straight, hard and lying
flat, so that it is rain-resisting.  Under the body to behind the legs, the
coat is longer and forms near the thigh a mild form of breeching. On
the head (including the inside of the ears), to the front of the legs and
feet, the hair is short.  Along the neck it is longer and thicker. A coat
either too long or too short is a fault.  As an average, the hairs on the
body should be from 2,5 to 4 cms in length.

Colour:
Blue mottled: The colour should be blue, blue mottled or blue
speckled with or without other markings.  The permissible markings
are black, blue or tan markings on the head, evenly distributed for
preference.  The forelegs tan midway up the legs and extending up
the front to breast  and throat, with tan on jaws ; the hindquarters tan
on inside of hindlegs, and inside of thighs, showing down the front
and the stifles and broadening out to the outside of the hindlegs from
hocks to toes.  Tan undercoat is permissible on the body providing it
does not show through the blue outer coat.  Black markings on the
body are not desirable.
Red speckle: The colour should be of good even red speckle all over,
including the undercoat, (neither white nor cream), with or without
darker red markings on the head.  Even head markings are desirable.
Red markings on the body are permissible but not desirable.

### SIZE AND WEIGHT:


Height at the withers:  Males:
46 to 51 cms.

Females:   43 to 48 cms.

FAULTS: Any departure from the foregoing points should be
considered a fault and the seriousness with which the fault should be
regarded should be in exact proportion to its degree and its effect
upon the health and welfare of the dog and on its ability to perform
its traditional work.



St-FCI n°287- 05.12.2012
