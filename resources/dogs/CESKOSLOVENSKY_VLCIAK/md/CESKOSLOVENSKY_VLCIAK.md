BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: In the year 1955 a biological
experiment took place in the CSSR of that time, namely, the crossing
of a German Shepherd Dog with a Carpathian wolf.  The experiment
established that the progeny of the mating of male dog to female
wolf as well as that of male wolf to female dog, could be reared.  The
vast majority of the products of these matings possessed the genetic
requirements for continuation of breeding.  In the year 1965, after the
ending of the experiment, a plan for the breeding of this new breed
was worked out.  This was to combine the usable qualities of the
wolf with the favourable qualities of the dog.  In the year 1982, the
Ceskoslovenský Vlciak, through the general committee of the
breeders’ associations of the CSSR of that time, was recognized as a
national breed.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: Firm type in constitution.  Above
average size with rectangular frame.  In body shape, movement, coat
texture, colour of coat and mask, similar to the wolf.

the outer corner of the eyes are in a direct line.  A vertical line from
tip of ear would run close along the head.




St-FCI n°332/03.09.1999

degrees to the horizontal.  The neck must be sufficiently long for the

### FOREQUARTERS:


General appearance: The front legs are straight, strong, clean and
close together with slightly turned out feet.
Shoulder: The shoulder blade is placed rather far forward, well
muscled.  It forms an angle of nearly 65 degrees to the horizontal.
Upper arm: Strongly muscled, forms an angle of 120 to 130 degrees
to the shoulder blade.
Elbow: Close fitting, turned neither in nor out, well defined, flexible.
Upper arm and forearm form an angle of approximately 150 degrees.
Forearm: Long, clean and straight.  The length of the forearm and
pastern is 55% of height at withers.
Pastern joint: Solid, flexible.



St-FCI n°332/03.09.1999
Pastern: Long, forms an angle of at least 75 degrees to the ground.
Lightly springy in movement.
Forefeet: Large, turned slightly outwards.  Longish arched toes and
strong, dark nails.  Well defined, elastic, dark pads.

### HINDQUARTERS:


General appearance: Powerful.  The hind legs stand parallel.  An
imaginary vertical line drawn from the point of the ischium, would
run midway through the hock joint.  The dewclaws are undesirable
and must be eliminated.
Upper thigh: Long, well muscled.  Forms an angle of 80 degrees to
the pelvis.  The hip joint is sturdy and flexible.
Stifle (Knee): Strong and flexible.
Lower thigh: Long, clean, well-muscled.  Forms an angle of about

winter an immense undercoat is predominant and, together with the
topcoat, forms a thick coat all over the body.  It is necessary for the
hair to cover the belly, the inside of the upper thigh, the scrotum, the
inner part of the ear and the area between the toes.  Well coated neck.

Colour: Yellowish-gray to silver-gray with a charateristic light mask.
Light hair also on the underside of the neck and the forechest.  Dark
gray colour with light mask is permissible.
