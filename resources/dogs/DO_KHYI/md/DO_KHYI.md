BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: The Tibetan Mastiff (Do
Khyi) is an ancient working breed of the nomad herders of the
Himalaya and a traditional guardian of the Tibetan monasteries.  It
has been surrounded by great myth since its first discovery in
antiquity.  From the mentioning by Aristoteles (384-322 b.C.) to the
famous writings of Marco Polo, who went to Asia in 1271, all
historical reports praise the natural strength and impressiveness of
the Tibetan Mastiff- both physically and mentally.  Even its bark has
been described as a unique and highly treasured feature of the breed.
Leading European cynologists of the past, like Martin and Youatt,
Megnin, Beckmann, Siber as well as Strebel and Bylandt have
intensively covered the Tibetan Mastiff, as they had been fascinated
by its origin and function in the Tibetan culture.  Some even
considered the breed to be the very forefather of all large mountain
and mastiff breeds.  One of the first known Tibetan Mastiffs to reach
Western shores was a male sent to Queen Victoria by Lord Hardinge
(then Viceroy of India) in 1847.  Later in the 1880s, Edward VII
(then Prince of Wales) took two dogs back to England.  An early
recorded litter of Tibetan Mastiffs was born in 1898 in the Berlin
Zoo.
