Group 6
Scenthounds, and related

With working trial.



BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: Initially only the Grand
Vendéen existed.  It was a short-haired variety of Vendéen
descending from the « Greffier » * or from the so-called « King ’s
white hound »*.  Neither should we forget mentioning the « griffon
fauve de Bretagne » in its origins because the former enters for an
important part into the bloodlines of the « Greffier ».  The « Chien
Gris de St. Louis » and the « Griffon de Bresse » (descendant of
Segusian ancestors) brought as well their contribution to the creation
of the Grand Griffon.
(* Early 16th century - Translator’s note.)

receptive and determined, distinguished in its shapes and gaits.  Well
proportioned construction, robust without heaviness.
