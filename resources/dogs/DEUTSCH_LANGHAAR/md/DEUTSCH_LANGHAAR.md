UTILIZATION: Versatile working Gundog. In accordance with his
various requirements as a versatile gundog the German Longhaired
Pointing Dog needs to have the required abilities for all work in field,
water and forest and for working well before and after the shot.

FCI-CLASSIFICATION:  Group
Pointing Dogs.

Section 1.2 Continental pointing



dogs, “Spaniel Type”.

With working trial.

BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: The German long-haired Pointing
Dog combines the bloodlines of a bird-, hawk- and water dog as well as of
Bracken (Scenthounds).  He therefore has scope for great versatility.
Since 1879 pure breeding has been carried out and the main characteristics
of the breed.  In 1897, Baron von Schorlemer wrote the first standard for
the German Long-haired and thus laid the foundation stone for today’s
pure breeding.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: Strong; muscular; low set; flowing lines.
Smaller dogs must have plenty of substance, but too massive and thereby
clumsy dogs are not desired.

IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS: Muzzle and skull of equal length. The
dog must not be overbuilt but slightly higher at shoulder than rump.

BEHAVIOUR/TEMPERAMENT: Balanced, calm, temperament, good
natured, easily trained.
