### FCI CLASSIFICATION:


Group 5
Spitz and primitive type.

Section 5
Asiatic Spitz and related



breeds.

Without working trial.

BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: In 1960 a breed was evolved
by crossing a Chow Chow and a Wolfspitz.  This was first called
« Wolf-Chow » and then, after crossing with a Samoyed, was renamed « Eurasier » (Eurasian) and recognized by the F.C.I.  The
breed was founded by Julius Wipfel.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: Balanced, well-constructed medium
sized dog of Spitz type with prick ears and coat in varied colours.
Length of coat should be such as still to reveal the body proportions.
With medium bone.

IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS: Length of body slightly longer
than height at withers.  The ratio of length of muzzle and length of
cranial region is almost equal.

BEHAVIOUR / TEMPERAMENT: Self-assured, calm, eventempered with high resistance against any provocation.  Watchful and
alert without being noisy.  Very strongly developed link to his family.
Relaxed towards strangers and not obtrusive.
For the full development of these qualities, the Eurasian needs
constant close domestic contact with his family and understanding, yet
consistent training.
