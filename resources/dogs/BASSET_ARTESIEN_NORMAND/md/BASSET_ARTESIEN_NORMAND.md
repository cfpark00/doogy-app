### BASSET ARTÉSIEN NORMAND


(Norman Artesien Basset)




FCI-St. N° 34 / 29.08.2023

TRANSLATION: Mrs. Peggy Davis.  Official language (FR).

ORIGIN: France.

### DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THE OFFICIAL VALID



### STANDARD: 01.08.2023.



UTILIZATION: Small game hunting dog used for hunting with
the gun.  Hunts as well by himself as in a pack, with giving tongue.
His short legs allow him to penetrate the most dense vegetation, there
where the big dog cannot go, and to flush out the hidden game.  His
favourite is hunting the rabbit, but he can just as well hunt the hare as
the deer.  He tracks and flushes with great determination driving the
game not fast, but with perseverance and giving voice.

FCI-CLASSIFICATION:  Group  6   Scenthounds and related
breeds.
Section  1.3 Small-sized Hounds.
With working trial.


BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY: The controlled breeding of
the short haired French Basset began in the years 1870.  From
Bassets having an apparently common origin, Count Le Couteulx of
Canteleu has fixed a utilitarian type with straight front legs called
Artois, whereas Mr. Louis Lane has developed a more spectacular
type, with crooked front legs, called Normand.  Only in 1924 the
name Artesien Norman Basset (Basset Artésien Normand) was
finally adopted for the breed and the club Mr. Léon Verrier, who
took over as chairman of the club in 1927, at the age of 77, has
wanted to strengthen the Norman character of the breed and in the
book of standards of hunting dogs of 1930, where the two breeds,
Basset d’Artois and Basset Artésien-Normand figure, we find the
following reference to this breed : “The committee of the “Société de
Vénerie” (Game Society) decides and notes that the Basset ArtésienNormand should not be but one stage of transition towards a Norman
type, without any trace of Artois.”



FCI-St. N° 34 / 29.08.2023

GENERAL APPEARANCE: Long dog in relation to its size, well
balanced, compact, recalling in his head the nobility of the big
Norman hound.

### IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS:



Height at withers: length of body
= about  5 : 8
Depth of chest:
height at the withers = about  2 : 3
Width of skull:
length of head
= about  1 : 2
Length of muzzle: length of skull
= about 10 : 10

BEHAVIOUR / TEMPERAMENT: Gifted with an excellent nose
and a melodious voice, persevere but not too fast on the line, he
permits his master to fully enjoy the hunting work.  Outgoing and of
very affectionate nature.

### HEAD



### CRANIAL REGION:


Skull: Dome shaped, medium width; occipital bone apparent.  On the
whole the head must have a dry look.


FCI-St. N° 34 / 29.08.2023
Stop: Marked without exaggeration.

### FACIAL REGION:


Nose: Black and large, slightly protruding over the lips; nostrils well
open.
Muzzle: Approximately the same length as that of the skull and
slightly aquiline.
Lips: Upper lip covering considerably the lower lip, without,
however, being too pendulous nor too tight-lipped.
Jaws/Teeth: Scissor bite, i.e. upper incisors covering the lower ones
in close contact are squarely set in relation to the jaws.
Cheeks: Formed by one or two folds of skin.

EYE: Oval shaped, large, dark (in harmony with the coat),
expression calm and serious; the haw (= conjunctival lining) of the
lower lid may sometimes show without excess.

EARS: Leathers set as low as possible, never above the line of the
eye, narrow at the base, well curled inwards corkscrew fashion,
supple, fine, very long, reaching at least the length of the muzzle and
preferably ending in a point.

NECK: Rather long, with some dewlap but without exaggeration.

### BODY:


Back: Wide and well supported.
Loin: Slightly tucked up.
Croup: Hips a little oblique, giving a slight slant to the rump.
Chest: Of ovalized section, long, sternum well prolonged backward
and prominent in front, with developed brisket.  Full flanks.  The
brisket sternal line is distinctly below the elbows.  Ribs long, carried
well back.

TAIL: Quite long, thick at base and thinning down progressively.
At rest the tip of the tail must just touch the ground.  Carried sabre
fashion but never falling on the back; its extremity must not be like a
plume.  On that subject it is absolutely forbidden to modify the look
of the stern of show dogs.


FCI-St. N° 34 / 29.08.2023


### LIMBS



### FOREQUARTERS:


General appearance: Forelegs are short and well-boned; they are
half-crooked or a little less than half-crooked, provided there is a
sufficient principle of crook visible.  Some folds of skin, without
excess, on the pasterns, must be considered as a quality.


Correct half-crooked forelegs

Shoulder: Muscular, oblique.
Elbow: Close to the body.
Forefeet: Oval shaped, a little elongated, toes rather close and placed
firmly on the ground giving maximum support.


### HINDQUARTERS:


General appearance: and seen from the back, a vertical line going
from the point of the high (buttock) goes through the middle of the
leg, the hock, the metatarsal and the foot.
Thighs: Fleshy and muscular.


FCI-St. N° 34 / 29.08.2023

Correct hindlegs, thighs rounded and well muscled


Hock: Strong, quite low, relatively bent, which places the hind foot
slightly under the dog when he is at rest.  A small pouch of skin at
the point of the hock (calcaneum) is not a fault.
Metatarsal: Short and strong.
Hind feet: Oval shaped, a little elongated, toes rather close and
placed firmly on the ground giving maximum support.

GAIT / MOVEMENT: Even, quite effortless and steady movement.

SKIN: Supple and fine.


### COAT


Hair: Close, short and smooth without being too fine.



FCI-St. N° 34 / 29.08.2023
Colour:  Fawn with black blanket and white (“tricolour”) or fawn
and white (“bi-colour).  In the tricoloured dog, the head should be
largely covered with tan hair and show a circle of darker hairs on
each temple.  The black blanket or the black patches should be
composed of solid black hairs or black hair with “grizzle” (realising
thus the former characteristic of “hare pied” or ”badger-pied”).

Tolerance             +/- 1 cm for exceptional


subjects.
Weight:

15 – 20 kg.
