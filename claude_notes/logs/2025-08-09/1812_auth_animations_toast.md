# Session Log - 2025-08-09
## Authentication Flow, Animations, and Toast Notifications

### Major Accomplishments

1. **Fixed Login/Logout Animation Direction**
   - Identified issue: login screen was sliding down on login (should slide up) and sliding up on logout (should slide down)
   - Root cause: React Navigation's animation interpolation was reversed
   - Solution: Changed `outputRange` from `[layouts.screen.height, 0]` to `[-layouts.screen.height, 0]`
   - Result: Login screen now slides UP to reveal main page, slides DOWN to cover on logout
   - Added 500ms timing for smooth transitions

2. **Fixed Drawer Close Timing on Logout**
   - Issue: Bright flash visible when logout triggered while drawer was closing
   - Solution: Added 300ms delay after drawer close (250ms animation) before triggering signOut
   - Result: Clean logout transition without visual artifacts

3. **Updated Onboarding Screen Design**
   - Replaced dog emoji with actual app icon (copied from iOS assets)
   - Removed emoji icons from feature list text (cleaner look)
   - Added proper Google icon using FontAwesome instead of magnifying glass
   - Adjusted font sizes: title (36px), description text (md+2)
   - Increased app icon size to 125x125 (1.25x bigger)
   - Center-aligned all text elements

4. **Implemented User-Friendly Toast Notifications**
   - Installed react-native-toast-message package
   - Created custom toast configuration with themed styling
   - Replaced ugly "No ID token" alerts with friendly toasts
   - Different toast types:
     - Info (white): "Login Cancelled - Sign in whenever you're ready"
     - Error (red): "Login Failed - Please try again"
   - Fixed toast width issue (set to 90% screen width)
   - Used proper theme colors throughout (no hard-coded values)
   - Added 60px top offset to avoid camera notch

5. **Error Handling Improvements**
   - Modified AuthContext to throw errors instead of showing alerts
   - OnboardingScreen now catches and handles errors with appropriate toasts
   - Distinguishes between cancellation and actual errors

### Technical Details

#### Animation Configuration
- Login (dismiss): Slides up from 0 to -screen.height
- Logout (present): Slides down from -screen.height to 0
- Both use 500ms timing animation
- Navigation handled via goBack() for login, navigate() for logout

#### Toast System Architecture
- Custom toast config with three types (error, success, info)
- Fully themed using app's color system
- Positioned at top with 60px offset
- 3-second visibility duration
- Icons from react-native-vector-icons/Feather

#### File Structure Changes
- Added: `/src/config/toastConfig.tsx`
- Added: `/src/assets/images/app_icon.png`
- Modified: `App.tsx`, `OnboardingScreen.tsx`, `AuthContext.tsx`, `HomeScreen.tsx`

### Issues Resolved
- Login/logout animation directions were inverted
- Toast notifications showed as white squares with no margin
- Hard-coded colors instead of theme references
- Drawer animation interfering with logout transition
- Unfriendly error messages for user cancellation

### Current State
- Smooth, intuitive animations for auth transitions
- Professional-looking login screen with app branding
- User-friendly error handling with themed toasts
- Clean logout flow without visual artifacts
- All UI elements properly themed and consistent
