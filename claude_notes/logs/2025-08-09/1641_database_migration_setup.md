## Database Migration and Schema Setup

### Major Accomplishments

1. **Database Migration System Overhaul**
   - Removed incremental migration approach (`001_initial_schema.sql`)
   - Created `complete_reset.sql` as idempotent reset script
   - Designed for rapid development iteration with full DB resets

2. **Comprehensive Database Schema Implementation**
   - **Core Tables:**
     - `profiles` - User profiles extending Supabase auth.users
     - `dogs` - Complete dog profiles with breed, age, medical notes, training level
   
   - **Activity & Health Tracking:**
     - `dog_activities` - Daily activity logs (walks, feeding, play, grooming, medication)
     - `veterinary_records` - Full vet visit history with diagnosis, treatments, documents
     - `training_sessions` - Command training progress with success rates
   
   - **Organization:**
     - `reminders` - Scheduled tasks with recurrence options
     - `conversations` - AI chat sessions linked to specific dogs
     - `messages` - Chat history with user/assistant roles

3. **Security Implementation**
   - Full Row Level Security (RLS) on all tables
   - Authentication required for any data access
   - Complete data isolation between users
   - Proper foreign key relationships throughout
   - Auto-create profile on user signup with trigger

4. **Bug Fixes and Improvements**
   - Fixed idempotency issue with DROP TRIGGER statements
   - Added ON CONFLICT handling for profile creation
   - Added exception handling in trigger functions
   - Added INSERT policy for profiles table

5. **Current App State Analysis**
   - Discovered app is NOT connected to database
   - Supabase client configured but unused
   - All data currently in memory only (no persistence)
   - Running in "local testing mode"

### Key Decisions

- **No Public Data:** Removed `is_public` flag - app is completely private per user
- **Idempotent Resets:** Using complete reset approach for rapid dev cycles
- **Comprehensive Schema:** Built full dog management schema upfront rather than incrementally

### Database Security Model

- **Non-authenticated users:** No access to any data
- **Authenticated users:** Can only see/edit their own data
- All policies use `auth.uid()` checks
- No cross-user data visibility

### Files Modified

- Deleted: `supabase/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql`
- Created: `supabase/migrations/complete_reset.sql`
- Updated: `supabase/migrations/README.md`

### Next Steps (Not Started)

- Connect app to Supabase database
- Implement authentication flow
- Add data persistence to ChatScreen
- Create dog profile management screens
- Implement activity tracking features
