# Session Log - 2025-08-09
## TestFlight Deployment & App Renaming

### Major Accomplishments

1. **Repository Analysis & Documentation**
   - Analyzed entire React Native + FastAPI codebase structure
   - Identified tech stack: React Native frontend, Python FastAPI backend, Supabase DB
   - Reviewed environment configuration and project organization

2. **Complete App Renaming (TempChatApp → Doogy)**
   - Updated all configuration files (app.json, package.json, Info.plist)
   - Renamed iOS project directories and files
   - Updated Android package from com.tempchatapp to com.doogy
   - Fixed xcscheme file naming issue that escaped initial grep
   - Reinstalled CocoaPods with new target name

3. **App Icon Setup**
   - Generated all required iOS icon sizes from 1024x1024 source
   - Created proper icon set in ios/Doogy/Images.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset/
   - Organized source assets in new resources/ directory
   - Updated Contents.json with proper icon mappings

4. **TestFlight Deployment**
   - Created App Store Connect app record for Doogy
   - Configured bundle identifier: com.doogy.doogy-app
   - Built and archived app in Xcode
   - Successfully uploaded to TestFlight (handling Hermes symbols warning)
   - Set up internal testing group for designer
   - Resolved export compliance requirements

5. **Documentation Creation**
   - Created comprehensive TestFlight first-time setup guide
   - Created streamlined update guide for subsequent builds
   - Documented complete setup process and common issues

### Technical Challenges Resolved

1. **Pod Configuration Issue**
   - After renaming, pods still referenced old TempChatApp
   - Solution: Complete pod deintegrate and reinstall

2. **Hidden File Naming Issues**
   - xcscheme file kept old name despite content changes
   - Grep searched file contents, not filenames
   - Solution: Explicit file rename

3. **Android Package Migration**
   - Package structure needed complete reorganization
   - Moved Kotlin files to new com.doogy package
   - Updated build.gradle namespace and applicationId

4. **TestFlight Compliance**
   - Missing export compliance blocked testing
   - Solution: Confirmed no special encryption usage

### File Structure Changes

- Created `/docs/` directory with TestFlight guides
- Created `/resources/` directory for design assets
- Renamed all iOS directories from TempChatApp to Doogy
- Reorganized Android package structure from com.tempchatapp to com.doogy
- Added comprehensive app icons to iOS assets

### Git Commits

1. "Add React Native chat app with FastAPI backend" - Initial major commit
2. "Rename app from TempChatApp to Doogy" - Complete rebranding

### Deployment Status

- ✅ App successfully deployed to TestFlight
- ✅ Internal testing group configured
- ✅ Designer can access via TestFlight
- ✅ Icons properly displaying
- ✅ Build 1.0 (1) live for testing

### Next Steps for Client

For future updates:
1. Increment build number in Xcode
2. Archive and upload (5-minute process)
3. Automatic distribution to test group
4. No reconfiguration needed

### Key Learnings

- TestFlight internal testing allows instant distribution to 100 testers
- Build numbers must be unique and incrementing
- Yellow dot on app icon indicates TestFlight beta
- Pod reinstall required after target name changes
- File renaming requires checking both content AND filenames

### Tools & Services Used

- Xcode for iOS development and archiving
- App Store Connect for TestFlight management
- CocoaPods for dependency management
- Git/GitHub for version control
- TestFlight app for beta distribution
