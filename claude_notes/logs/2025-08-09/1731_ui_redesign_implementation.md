### Technical Details

#### Files Created/Modified:
- `src/theme/index.ts` - Main theme configuration
- `src/theme/DESIGNER_GUIDE.md` - Documentation for designers
- `src/screens/HomeScreen.tsx` - Complete rewrite with split view
- `src/screens/ThemePreview.tsx` - Theme preview screen
- `src/screens/OnboardingScreen.tsx` - Updated with new theme
- `src/assets/images/default_avatar.png` - Moved from root
- `ios/Doogy/Info.plist` - Added UIAppFonts for vector icons
- All components updated to use new theme system

#### Key Features Implemented:
- **Draggable Split View**: Innovative UI with draggable divider
- **Smart Mode Switching**: Auto-switch between chat/dashboard
- **Professional Icons**: Feather icons via react-native-vector-icons
- **User Context Integration**: Shows Google auth profile/initials
- **Responsive Animations**: 250ms synchronized close animations
- **Theme Consistency**: All colors from centralized theme

### Challenges Resolved

1. **Modal Blocking**: Fixed interaction blocking after drawer close
2. **Icon Display**: Resolved [?] icons with proper pod install and rebuild
3. **Theme Standards**: Converted from JSON to TypeScript following React Native best practices

### UI/UX Improvements

- Golden/mustard color scheme for warm, friendly feel
- Removed visual clutter (extra hamburger menu)
- Increased font sizes for better readability
- Reduced spacing between drawer items
- Red logout button for clear action indication

  "react-native-vector-icons": "^10.3.0",
  "@types/react-native-vector-icons": "^6.4.18"
}
```

### Next Steps/Recommendations
1. Consider replacing Modal-based drawer with react-navigation/drawer
2. Implement actual image picker for avatar customization
3. Add dark mode support to theme system
4. Create settings screens for menu items
5. Implement notification preferences

### Summary
Successfully transformed the app from a basic chat interface to a modern, interactive dashboard with professional UI/UX. The new golden theme, draggable interface, and proper icon library create a polished, production-ready appearance. All changes follow React Native best practices and industry standards.
