# Session Log: Breeds Database Setup and Data Bundling System
**Date**: 2025-08-18
**Time**: 00:11
**Focus**: iOS build fixes, HomeScreen refactoring, breeds table setup, secure data bundling

## Summary
Fixed iOS build issues after react-native-svg installation, performed major HomeScreen refactoring to clean up code while maintaining exact visual appearance, and implemented a complete breeds database system with secure data bundling for offline search capability.

## Tasks Completed

### 1. iOS Build Error Resolution
- **Fixed app stuck at splash screen** after react-native-svg installation
- **Resolved Codegen missing files** error:
  - Cleaned all iOS build artifacts and DerivedData
  - Removed and reinstalled node_modules
  - Ran fresh pod install to regenerate Codegen files
  - Started Metro bundler with cache reset
- Successfully launched app on iPhone 16 Pro simulator

### 2. HomeScreen Refactoring
- **Removed HomeScreenV2** component completely (user request)
- **Refactored 856-line HomeScreen.tsx** while maintaining exact visual appearance:
  - Moved chat input to bottom of golden top section (not in divider)
  - Adjusted corner radius and margins for cleaner look
  - Fixed progress circle to show actual 63% (removed mock calculation)
  - Attempted multiple progress implementations before settling on simple ring
- **Key UI fixes**:
  - Chat input now properly positioned at bottom of top section
  - Removed dummy text from bottom dashboard area
  - Adjusted margins and styling per user feedback

### 3. Breeds Database Architecture
- **Created breeds table** in Supabase with minimal schema:
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE breeds (
    id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE, -- breed_id like GOLDEN_RETRIEVER
    display_name TEXT NOT NULL, -- clean name from metadata
    alt_names TEXT[], -- alternative names for search
    breed_info TEXT, -- markdown content from md files
    breed_nutrition_info TEXT, -- empty for now
    breed_social_info TEXT, -- empty for now
    breed_activity_info TEXT, -- empty for now
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
  );
  ```
- **Made migration idempotent** by adding breeds to DROP statements
- **Added proper RLS policies** for read-only access by authenticated users
- **Updated dogs table** to reference breeds via breed_id

### 4. Secure Data Bundling System
- **Created populate-breeds.js script**:
  - Reads from `/resources/dogs/` directory (344 breeds)
  - Extracts metadata including common_display_name and alt_names
  - Loads full markdown content from md files
  - Batch inserts into Supabase using service role key
- **Created generate-breeds-data.js script**:
  - Fetches breeds from database
  - Generates static breeds.json (177KB)
  - Bundles with app for offline search
  - Includes alt_names for better search (e.g., "Goldie" finds Golden Retriever)
- **Security implementation**:
  - Service role key NEVER in client app
  - Updated .env with placeholder for service role key
  - Enhanced .env.example with all fields and security warnings
  - Created /docs/SECURITY.md with guidelines
  - breeds.json bundled at build time (no runtime API calls)

### 5. Data Organization
- **Processed dogs.zip archive**:
  - Moved to resources directory
  - Renamed mds/ to dogs/
  - Re-zipped for consistency
- **Generated breeds.json** with optimized structure:
  - Clean display names from metadata
  - Alternative names for fuzzy search
  - Comprehensive searchText field
  - No unnecessary fields (removed size_category, temperament, etc.)

## Technical Decisions

### Why Two-Script Approach
1. **populate-breeds.js** - Uses service role key to populate database
2. **generate-breeds-data.js** - Creates static JSON from database for bundling

This ensures:
- Service role key never exposed in app
- Breeds data works offline
- Fast, local search without network calls
- Easy to update breed data independently

### Database Design
- Minimal fields in breeds table (just what's needed)
- Full markdown content stored as breed_info
- Empty fields ready for future nutrition/social/activity content
- Alt_names array for comprehensive search

## Files Modified
- `/supabase/migrations/complete_reset.sql` - Added breeds table
- `/supabase/populate-breeds.js` - Script to populate breeds
- `/scripts/generate-breeds-data.js` - Script to generate JSON
- `/src/assets/data/breeds.json` - Generated breed data (177KB)
- `/.env` - Added service role key placeholder
- `/.env.example` - Enhanced with all fields and warnings
- `/docs/SECURITY.md` - Created security guidelines
- `/src/screens/HomeScreen.tsx` - Refactored and cleaned
- `/src/screens/HomeScreenV2.tsx` - Deleted

## Next Steps
- Implement breed search autocomplete in OnboardingScreen
- Add breed selection UI with fuzzy search
- Consider adding breed images in future
- Fill nutrition/social/activity info fields when content available

## Notes
- All 344 breeds successfully populated in database
- breeds.json optimized for search with alt_names
- System designed for offline-first operation
- Security-first approach with no exposed keys
