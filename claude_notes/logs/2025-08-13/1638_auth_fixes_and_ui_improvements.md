## Auth Refresh Token Fixes and Home Screen UI Improvements

### Summary
Fixed critical Supabase authentication refresh token errors and attempted multiple iterations of home screen UI improvements. The session involved proper error handling for invalid refresh tokens and extensive work on the home screen's chat input and layout behavior.

### Major Accomplishments

#### 1. Refresh Token Error Resolution
- **Error**: "Invalid Refresh Token: Refresh Token Not Found" causing app crashes
- **Root Cause**: Expired or invalidated refresh tokens not being handled properly
- **Solution Implemented**:
  - Added error handling in `AuthContext.tsx` at three key points:
    - Initial session check with refresh token error detection
    - Auth state change handler for TOKEN_REFRESHED events
    - App resume handler to check token validity
  - Automatically signs out user when refresh token is invalid
  - Clears session and redirects to login for fresh authentication

#### 2. Home Screen UI Iterations
- **Initial Problem**: Chat input was in the draggable divider between sections
- **User Request**: Move chat input to be part of the top section
- **Multiple Attempts**:
  1. First moved input to bottom section (user clarified this was wrong)
  2. Then moved to bottom of top section with cream-colored rounded box styling
  3. Fixed drag behavior - removed auto-snap, made it stay where dragged
  4. Removed gray drag bar divider completely per user request
  5. Added tap-to-focus behavior for sections
  6. Fixed send button styling with Feather icon
  7. Fixed z-index layering issues with cream overlay

#### 3. Complete Home Screen Rewrite Attempt
- **User Frustration**: Keyboard interaction and overall code quality issues
- **Research**: Looked up React Native chat UI best practices for 2024
- **Created HomeScreenV2.tsx**:
  - Proper KeyboardAvoidingView implementation
  - Clean view mode switching (welcome/chat)
  - Fixed input bar at bottom
  - Removed problematic draggable divider
  - Better navigation with home button
  - Professional structure with callbacks and refs
- **Result**: User found V2 even worse, reverted to original

### Technical Details

#### Authentication Fixes
- Modified `/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`:
  - Enhanced `getSession()` with error parameter checking
  - Added refresh token error detection in multiple handlers
  - Implemented graceful sign-out on token failure

#### UI Components Modified
- `/src/screens/HomeScreen.tsx`:
  - Restructured layout with TouchableWithoutFeedback wrappers
  - Changed divider from visual element to invisible drag area
  - Moved chat input between different sections multiple times
  - Updated styles for proper z-index layering
  - Changed send button from text arrow to Feather icon

### Files Created/Modified
- Modified: `/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` (refresh token error handling)
- Modified: `/src/screens/HomeScreen.tsx` (extensive UI changes)
- Created: `/src/screens/HomeScreenV2.tsx` (complete rewrite, later unused)
- Modified: `/App.tsx` (temporarily switched to V2, then reverted)

### Key Learnings
1. User had very specific vision for UI that required multiple iterations
2. Drag behavior and section interactions were particularly challenging
3. Sometimes "better" code (V2) isn't what the user wants
4. Refresh token handling is critical for auth stability

### Unresolved Issues
- Home screen keyboard interaction still problematic
- Overall code quality of HomeScreen.tsx remains poor per user
- Drag/scroll behavior may need further refinement

### User Feedback
- Frustrated with multiple UI attempts not matching vision
- Expressed that home screen code quality is "so so so shit"
- Rejected the "clean" V2 rewrite in favor of iterating on original

### Next Steps Suggested
- Consider alternative approach to home screen layout
- May need to revisit keyboard handling strategy
- Could benefit from mockup or clearer design specification
