## Splash Screen, Navigation Flow, and Onboarding Improvements

### Summary
Major improvements to app launch experience, navigation flow, and onboarding UX. Implemented splash screen, fixed navigation animations, resolved onboarding progress persistence, and enhanced form usability.

### Major Accomplishments

#### 1. Splash Screen Implementation
- **New SplashScreen Component**: Created animated splash screen with logo, title, and subtitle
- **Logo Animation**: Fade-in and scale animations using React Native Animated API
- **App Icon Integration**: Used proper app_icon.png (initially mistakenly used dog_pic.png)
- **Styling**: 120x120 logo container with shadow, 42pt title, white text on primary background

#### 2. Navigation Flow Overhaul
- **Splash-First Navigation**: Modified App.tsx to show splash screen on every app launch
- **Auth State Detection**: Splash shows while loading auth state, then navigates to appropriate screen:
  - No auth → Login screen (direct navigation, no animation)
  - Auth but not onboarded → Onboarding screen
  - Auth and onboarded → Home screen
- **Removed Login Animation**: Eliminated the problematic login screen drop animation
- **Minimum Splash Time**: Initially 1.5s fixed delay, then optimized to show only during auth loading

#### 3. Onboarding Progress Persistence
- **Critical Bug Fix**: Onboarding progress was not being saved to database
- **Auto-Save Implementation**: Added `saveProgress()` function with useEffect hooks
- **State Management**: Progress saves on every step change, ownership status change, dog count change, and dog data updates
- **Resume Capability**: Users can refresh/restart and continue from where they left off

#### 4. Onboarding UI Improvements
- **Dog Count Selection**: Replaced problematic text input with 2x2 grid of buttons (1, 2, 3, 4+)
- **Button Grid Layout**: Square buttons using aspectRatio: 1, centered 2x2 layout
- **Validation Fix**: Prevented users from entering 0 dogs (which broke the flow)
- **Training Levels**: Added more options (6 total) and attempted to fix scrolling issues
- **ScrollView Problems**: Multiple attempts to fix scrolling in training level selection

#### 5. Navigation Structure Updates
- **RootStackParamList**: Added Splash screen to navigation types
- **Initial Route**: Set Splash as initialRouteName instead of MainPage
- **Animation Configuration**: Removed KeyboardAvoidingView conflicts, simplified layout structure

### Technical Challenges

#### ScrollView Issues
- **Persistent Problem**: Training level options not scrolling despite multiple layout fixes
- **Attempted Solutions**:
  - Added ScrollView around training options
  - Removed nested ScrollView conflicts
  - Modified flex layouts and contentContainerStyle
  - Restructured navigation button positioning
  - Added explicit height and flexGrow properties
- **Root Cause**: Complex flex layout with KeyboardAvoidingView and navigation buttons competing for space

#### Navigation Complexity
- **Auth State Management**: Complex logic to determine initial route based on session/onboarding status
- **Animation Conflicts**: Login screen animation interfering with direct navigation flow
- **State Persistence**: Ensuring auth context properly loads saved onboarding progress

### User Experience Improvements
- **Immediate Feedback**: Splash screen provides visual feedback during app initialization
- **Error Prevention**: Button-based dog count selection prevents invalid inputs
- **Progress Safety**: Auto-save ensures users never lose onboarding progress
- **Visual Consistency**: Square button grid matches app design language

### Code Structure Changes
- **New Files**: 
  - `/src/screens/SplashScreen.tsx` - Animated splash screen component
- **Modified Files**:
  - `App.tsx` - Complete navigation flow restructure
  - `/src/screens/OnboardingScreen.tsx` - Progress saving, UI improvements
  - `/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Enhanced auth state management

### Database Integration
- **Progress Storage**: Onboarding progress stored in profiles.preferences JSONB field
- **Auto-Save Logic**: Progress automatically saves on state changes
- **Resume Logic**: `loadOnboardingProgress()` restores saved state on app restart

### Remaining Issues
- **ScrollView Bug**: Training level selection still not scrolling properly on smaller screens
- **Layout Complexity**: Onboarding screen layout needs simplification for better scrolling behavior

### Next Steps Recommended
1. Simplify onboarding layout structure to fix scrolling issues
2. Test app flow on various device sizes
3. Consider implementing proper keyboard handling for text inputs
4. Add loading states during progress saving operations

### User Feedback Integration
- User complained about non-functional scrolling multiple times
- User requested specific button layout (2x2 grid without "dogs" text)
- User emphasized importance of progress persistence
- User preferred direct navigation over animated transitions

This session significantly improved the app's launch experience and onboarding reliability, though some layout challenges remain to be resolved.
