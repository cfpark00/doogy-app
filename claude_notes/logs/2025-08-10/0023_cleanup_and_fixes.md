# Session Log: Code Cleanup, Bug Fixes, and Onboarding Improvements
**Date**: 2025-08-10
**Time**: 00:23
**Focus**: Unused code removal, security fixes, onboarding flow improvements, UI refinements

## Summary
Performed comprehensive code cleanup, fixed critical onboarding flow bugs, improved security by removing hardcoded secrets, and enhanced UI consistency across screens.

## Tasks Completed

### 1. Code Cleanup and Unused Dependencies Removal
- **Removed 5 unused npm packages**:
  - `@react-native/new-app-screen`
  - `react-native-app-auth`
  - `react-native-dotenv`
  - `react-native-get-random-values`
  - `@types/react-native-vector-icons`
- **Deleted unused files**:
  - `src/services/supabase.ts` (duplicate of `src/lib/supabase.ts`)
  - `src/components/ChatInput.tsx` (completely unused component)
  - `src/utils/` (empty directory)
- **Cleaned up unused imports** in App.tsx and HomeScreen.tsx

### 2. Security Improvements
- **Removed hardcoded secrets** from git history
- **Updated iOS configuration** to use environment variables instead of hardcoded Google Client ID
- Created build-time configuration system:
  - Added `ios/.env.example` template
  - Created `ios/scripts/set-google-client-id.sh` script
  - Updated Info.plist to use `$(GOOGLE_IOS_REVERSED_CLIENT_ID)` variable
  - Added proper gitignore entries for sensitive configs

### 3. Database Schema Updates
- **Updated profiles table** schema:
  - Changed from `username/display_name` to `name/email`
  - Added `dog_ownership_status` field (owner/looking/none)
  - Added `dog_count` field
- **Fixed profile creation** to properly extract Google auth metadata
- Made complete_reset.sql fully idempotent

### 4. Onboarding Flow Redesign
- **Added initial dog ownership question** with three options:
  - "Yes, I have a dog" → leads to full questionnaire
  - "Not yet, but looking" → shows encouragement message
  - "Just exploring" → minimal onboarding
- **Support for multiple dogs** (up to 10)
- **Fixed critical navigation bug** where "Get Started" button appeared too early
- **Fixed profile creation error** for new users (changed `.single()` to `.maybeSingle()`)
- **Removed auto-save functionality** and "Saving..." indicator for cleaner UX
- Made only dog name required (breed, age, weight optional)

### 5. UI/UX Improvements

#### HomeScreen Updates
- **Changed center avatar** from user photo to dog photo
- Uses `dog_pic.png` as default placeholder (48x48 size)
- Updated welcome message to show dog's name: "Max's Day"
- Personalized question text with dog's name
- **Added dual SafeAreaView pattern** for consistent color separation:
  - Golden background for status bar area
  - Cream background for home indicator area

#### AuthContext Improvements
- Fixed onboarding completion to properly update state
- Added profile creation with Google metadata (name, email, avatar_url)
- Improved error handling for missing profiles

#### Navigation Fixes
- Fixed App.tsx navigation to properly reset stack when onboarded
- Ensured smooth transition from onboarding to home screen

## Files Modified
- `/App.tsx` - Navigation and import cleanup
- `/src/screens/OnboardingScreen.tsx` - Complete redesign of onboarding flow
- `/src/screens/HomeScreen.tsx` - UI updates for dog-centric design
- `/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Profile handling improvements
- `/supabase/migrations/complete_reset.sql` - Schema updates
- `/package.json` - Removed unused dependencies
- `/.gitignore` - Added iOS config entries
- Multiple iOS configuration files for build-time variable injection

## Files Created
- `/docs/ios-configuration.md` - iOS setup documentation
- `/ios/.env.example` - Environment variable template
- `/ios/scripts/set-google-client-id.sh` - Build configuration script
- `/ios/scripts/xcode-prebuild.sh` - Xcode prebuild hook

## Files Deleted
- `/src/services/supabase.ts`
- `/src/components/ChatInput.tsx`
- `/src/utils/` directory

## Key Bug Fixes
1. **Onboarding navigation**: Fixed "Get Started" button appearing before collecting dog information
2. **Profile creation**: Fixed error when new users sign in (no profile exists)
3. **Navigation after onboarding**: Fixed returning to login screen instead of home
4. **Safe area colors**: Implemented proper dual SafeAreaView pattern for different top/bottom colors

## Testing Notes
- Onboarding flow tested for all three user types (owner, looking, none)
- Multiple dog support verified
- Database migrations are idempotent and can be run safely multiple times
- iOS configuration system tested and working

## Next Steps / Recommendations
1. Implement actual image picker for dog photo upload
2. Add ability to edit dog profiles after onboarding
3. Consider adding dog switcher for users with multiple dogs
4. Implement the drawer menu items (Settings, Profile, etc.)
5. Add proper error handling for database operations
6. Consider adding onboarding progress persistence to cloud

## Technical Debt Addressed
- Removed all unused dependencies reducing bundle size
- Eliminated duplicate code and configuration files
- Improved code organization and consistency
- Removed hardcoded values in favor of environment variables

## Notes
- The onboarding flow now properly handles all three user types
- Database schema is more flexible for future features
- Security posture improved by removing secrets from version control
- UI is now consistently dog-centric rather than user-centric
